## Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}

This paper, referenced as the yellow paper, assumes that the reader is
familiar with the general idea behind the Morpho protocol. To strengthen
their intuition about the Morpho protocol, the reader may first go
through the white paper [@morphowhite].

Compound and Aave ([@gudgeon2020defi; @perez2020liquidations]) have
established themselves as the current standard for decentralized lending
protocols over the past years. These protocols, operating autonomously
on-chain, implement a liquidity pool that offers strong liquidity
guarantees and floating rates. Different protocols have been designed to
improve on PLFs, protocols for loanable funds, in different aspects. One
of these aspects is going from floating to fixed rates, and many
protocols are tackling this issue. For example, APWine [@apwinedoc],
Sense [@sensedoc], and 88mph [@88mphdoc] allow the user to trade their
yield. Yield Protocol [@yieldwpp] and Notional [@notionalwpp] define a
similar concept to collateralized zero-coupon bonds.

The Morpho protocol, for its part, leverages the composability and
liquidity of existing PLFs, to create efficient and liquid peer-to-peer
markets of supply and borrow positions with near-zero spread. The claim
is that Morpho strictly improves pool-based liquidity protocols from an
individual user perspective. In particular, Morpho has the same
liquidation parameters and benefits from the same liquidity of the
underlying protocols.

The first goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive description
of the Morpho protocol and its unique mechanisms. Then, to demonstrate
the claims, this paper will provide mathematical properties and proofs
about the logic underpinning the protocol. The aim is to bring
transparency while educating and providing trust for the community to
the key variables and invariant assumptions it utilizes.

The paper structure is as follows. In
section [1](#logical-framework){reference-type="ref"
reference="logical-framework"}, we detail the logical framework we place
ourselves into. Our formalization is based on a transition system with
transition functions written in pseudo-code.
Section [2](#on-chain-env){reference-type="ref"
reference="on-chain-env"} describes the on-chain environment that will
be useful for Morpho, including the involved contracts' functions.
Section [3](#morpho-description){reference-type="ref"
reference="morpho-description"} details the structure and operation of
Morpho, giving us a basis to analyze and prove some of its relevant
invariants. Section [4](#matching-engine){reference-type="ref"
reference="matching-engine"} looks at the matching engine at the heart
of the protocol, allowing matching and unmatching users when needed. The
matching engine is voluntarily left abstract. The intent is to allow for
different implementations.
Section [5](#index-mechanism){reference-type="ref"
reference="index-mechanism"} focuses on the interest rates mechanism and
their associated accounting. Finally,
section [6](#delta-mechanism){reference-type="ref"
reference="delta-mechanism"} presents the delta mechanism allowing the
protocol to scale despite the limited computation power available in a
blockchain setting.

An emphasis is put on the correctness of the protocol, and different
aspects of it are detailed along the way: balances integrity, covering
borrow, supply, and aggregated peer-to-peer integrity, Morpho's
positions integrity on the pool, as well as the liquidity of the
positions.

# Logical framework

In this first section, we aim to give a high-level description of the
setting to reason about the Morpho protocol and its environment. We
first detail the basic functionalities of the blockchain that we will
build upon, which allows us to then describe our formalization of the
blockchain in terms of a transition system. The formal description is
close to the code, with sufficient details for describing invariants and
proofs.

## Definitions

We place ourselves in the blockchain setting where we have access to a
set of **addresses** $A$. An address[^3] $a \in A$ refers either to a
**contract** or a user. For the sake of simplicity, the term 'user' and
the address associated with their account on the blockchain will be used
interchangeably throughout this yellow paper.

Contracts are defined by their state variables and functions, similar to
attributes and methods in object-oriented programming. From its
deployment, a contract stores its variables, which are modified later by
the function calls made by the users. Types take one of the following
form:

- Primitive types $T$: booleans ($B$), integers ($\mathbb{N}$), real
  numbers ($\mathbb{R}$), non-negative real numbers ($\mathbb{R}_+$)
  and addresses ($A$). Notice that instead of using fixed-point
  arithmetic, we introduce real numbers to model the variables in
  question.

- Products $T_1 \times T_2$ of two primitive types, $T_1$ and $T_2$:
  pairs of a value in $T_1$ and a value in $T_2$. We will denote
  products by separating the values by commas. We identify products up
  to associativity such that we can omit parenthesis to disambiguate
  the order of a product: $T_1 \times (T_2 \times T_3)$ is the same as
  $(T_1 \times T_2) \times T_3$ and will be written as
  $T_1 \times T_2 \times T_3$.

- Mappings $T_1 \to T_2$ from a primitive type $T_1$ to a type $T_2$:
  vectors of the space of sequences indexed by $T_1$ with values in
  $T_2$. For a mapping $m$ and a key $i$, $m(i)$ describes the value
  associated to $i$ in $m$. If $v$ is in $T_2$, then $m[i \mapsto v]$
  refers to the mapping $m$ where the value associated to $i$ is $v$
  instead of $m(i)$.

Each contract has its own set of variables, which we will call the
contract's **storage**, accessible through its address. We place
ourselves in a simpler setting where the storage is the association of
variables to their values for all the variables of all the contracts.
Storage variables are thus directly accessible through their name in the
storage. In this way, the mapping notation will also be used for
storage, so for $\kappa$ as the storage, the notation $\kappa(i)$ refers
to the value of the variable $i$ stored in $\kappa$. To keep the
notation concise, we often omit the storage and write $i$ for the value
of the variable $i$.

Functions may read and modify storage variables, and we model this
behavior by a transition system.

## Transition system

The blockchain can be seen as a transition system where the state
consists of the storage and the time, and the transition function is
determined from the functions of the contracts. We use the following
notations when a function $f$ is called:

- $d \in D_f$ is the function input given by the caller, $D_f$ is the
  domain of $f$

- $\sigma_i \in \Sigma$ is the current state, $\Sigma$ is the set of
  states

- $r \in R_f$ is the output of the function, $R_f$ is the image of $f$

- $\sigma_r \in \Sigma$ is the new (changed) state.

$$f: D_f \rightarrow R_f$$ The transition function $\Gamma$ is defined
in the following way. For each function call, we add a transition from
$\sigma_i$ to $\sigma_r$ labeled by $(d, r)$. All the transitions added
for $f$ can be described as a transition function $\Gamma_f$, where
$\Gamma_f(d, \sigma_i) = (r, \sigma_r)$.
$$\Gamma_f: D_f \times \Sigma \rightarrow R_f \times \Sigma$$ Some
function calls are only possible in some contexts for a particular
configuration of the current state. In such a case the transition is not
added. Moreover, some functions are defined by calling other functions.
When the call of the callee function does not correspond to a
transition, the call of the caller function also does not correspond to
a new transition. This behavior mimics error handling in programming
languages.

::: exmp
**Example 1**. _Let's give the example of a contract with user accounts
and authorizations that is inspired from Unix systems. To be concise, we
omit the particular implementation, and suppose that:_

- _In the initial state there are 3 normal accounts, account $A$, $B$
  and $C$. The account $B$ is the owner of the contract._

- _There is a function _`su`_ that takes an account as an input
  parameter and promotes it to $root$. This function is only defined
  for the owner._

- _There is a function _`exit`_ that takes a root account as an input
  parameter and demotes it to a normal account._

- _There is a function _`userdel`_ that takes two accounts as input
  parameters. This function is only defined when the first account is
  $root$, and deletes the second account when this is the case. To
  limit the number of accessible states, we only define this function
  when the deleted account is the account C._

_The following figure represents this transition system. We label each
transition with its corresponding function call for clarity and omit the
returned value (as it is unused)._

::: center
![image](assets/auth.png){width="12cm"}
:::

_Notice that the user $A$ is not able to become $root$, this is
represented by the absence of a transition from state $1$ to state $5$.
This means that if the user $A$ tries to call a function that batches
_`su`_, _`userdel`_ and _`exit`_ (equivalent to the command
_`sudo userdel C`_), this call would fail._
:::

Function calls do not change the time parameter, and we add one
transition function that changes the time:
$$\Gamma_{tick}: \mathbb{1} \times \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{1} \times \Sigma$$
with $\Gamma_{tick}(0, (t, \kappa)) = (0, (t+1, \kappa))$. We used the
notation $\mathbb{1}$ for the singleton set containing $0$. Thus, for a
given path, multiple states can have the same time parameter. If we go
back to the blockchain setting, this is useful to model the evolution of
the storage inside one particular block. To keep it simple, we will
write the time parameter as a subscript when there is no ambiguity about
which storage it refers to or omit the time entirely when it is
irrelevant. We will also allow ourselves to use the notation of the
storage directly to the state. Notably, for $\sigma = (t, \kappa)$, the
notation $\sigma(i)$ refers to $\kappa(i)$.

::: exmp
**Example 2**. _Consider a counter contract, whose storage is made of a
single integer $i \in \mathbb{N}$, and which has a single function
$\texttt{\upshape incrementBy}$, that increments a variable $i$ by an
input parameter $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and returns the new value. Here we
have $D_{\texttt{\upshape incrementBy}} = \mathbb{N}$,
$R*{\texttt{\upshape incrementBy}} = \mathbb{N}$, and:*

_$$\Gamma_\texttt{\upshape incrementBy}(n, \sigma) = (\sigma(i)+n, \sigma[i \mapsto \sigma(i)+n])$$\_
:::

In the following, we will only consider the transition functions
$\Gamma_f$ associated to a computable function $f$. Such functions can
be described more simply by pseudo-code, where $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_r$
store respectively the values of all the variables before and after the
function call, and $d$ and $r$ are the input and the output of the
function. When defining these functions, we will specify their domain
and codomain ($D_f$ and $R_f$) and assume that the function has access
to the state.

::: exmp
**Example 3**. _The previous example could be more easily described by
the following pseudo-code:_

    function incrementBy(n):
        i += n
        return i

:::

::: exmp
**Example 4**. _Define view functions[^4] as functions that can read the
state but cannot modify it. A function $f$ is a view function if and
only if for each argument $d$ and storage $\sigma$, the second element
of the pair $\Gamma_f(d, \sigma)$ is $\sigma$._

# On-chain environment {#on-chain-env}

The Morpho protocol uses two types of contracts: tokens[^5] and PLFs,
which are pool-based liquidity protocols. They constitutes the on-chain
environment of Morpho, and we discuss the inner workings of such
contracts in this section.

## Tokens

Tokens are contracts that represent a transferrable store of value. We
call $\Theta$ the set of tokens.

### Storage

A token contract stores balances, which represent the amount held by
each user.

#### $\text{Balances}$:

The variable $m$, called the balances, is a mapping from addresses to
real numbers.

$$m: A \to \mathbb{R}_+$$

### Functions

A token contract can transfer funds from one address to another.

#### $\text{Transfer}$:

Transfer $\texttt{amount} \in \mathbb{R}_+$ of the token balance of an
address $\texttt{from} \in A$, to another address $\texttt{to} \in A$,
where $\texttt{amount} \le m(\texttt{from})$.
$$\texttt{transfer}: A \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
A simple implementation of the transfer function could look like the
following:

    transfer(from, to, amount):
        if amount > $m$(from):
            raise error
        $m$(from) -= amount
        $m$(to) += amount

Remark that the transfer is only possible when the sender has sufficient
funds. In this case, it does not correspond to a new transition in the
transition system.

## Protocol for loanable funds {#plf}

Let $\Psi$ be the set of protocols for loanable funds[^6]. For each
contract $\psi \in \Psi$, we note $\Theta_\psi$ the subset of $\Theta$
of tokens available for lending and borrowing in $\psi$. A protocol
$\psi \in \Psi$ should make available, for each token
$\theta \in \Theta_\psi$, user entry points with functions to lend,
borrow, withdraw lent funds, repay borrowed funds, and liquidate a
position. In the following, we set the protocol $\psi$, which allows us
to omit it in the notation. To be concise, we use the subscript notation
to denote a function taking a token as an argument.

### Storage

The storage of a protocol for loanable funds should store the balances
of the borrowers and of the suppliers. It should also store the
collateral factors of assets, which define the maximum debt a user can
maintain. Liquidation of the position can happen if this limit is
reached. See subsection [2.2.3](#external-plf){reference-type="ref"
reference="external-plf"} for more details about the `liquidate`
function.

#### Collateral factor:

For a given asset, the collateral factor[^7] represents the maximum
share of the value of the collateral that can be borrowed with this as
collateral. The collateral factor values are fixed between $0$ and $1$,
with $0$ for assets that are not accepted as collateral[^8].
$$F: \Theta_\psi \to [0,1]$$

::: exmp
**Example 5**. _Alice deposits 1000 `DAI` (worth 1000\$) on Compound,
whose collateral factor is 80%. Alice can now borrow up to 800\$ worth
of assets._
:::

#### Rates:

Supply and borrow rates, $r^S$ and $r^B$, respectively, represent the
growing speed of the balances per unit of time[^9]: $$\begin{gathered}
r^S: \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+\\
r^B: \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+
\end{gathered}$$

::: exmp
**Example 6**. _If Alice deposits 1000 `DAI`, and
$r^S_{\texttt{DAI}} = 0.01$, after 10 units of time (second or block
depending on the protocol), the accrued interest would be
$1000 \times (1+r^S_{\texttt{DAI}})^{10} = 1104.62$.\_
:::

#### Balances:

The balances are mappings reflecting the users' balances, in a unit that
grows in underlying value, at a speed that depends either on the supply
rate $r^S$ for the supply balance $s$ or on the borrow rate $r^B$ for
the borrow balance $b$. $$\begin{gathered}
s: A \to \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+\\
b: A \to \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+
\end{gathered}$$

#### Indexes:

The supply and borrow indexes, $\lambda^S$ and $\lambda^B$,
respectively, are the exchange rates between stored balances in the
scaled unit and underlying tokens. According to the interest rate model,
they constantly grow with time at a speed that depends on $r^S$ and
$r^B$, respectively, to accrue the interests of suppliers and borrowers.
The amount of underlying tokens corresponding to an amount in the scaled
unit is obtained by multiplying this last one by the corresponding
index. $$\begin{gathered}
\lambda^S: \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+\\
\lambda^B: \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+
\end{gathered}$$

Having indexes to track interest rate accrual is particularly suitable
in a blockchain environment, where computations are limited. It removes
the need for an active accounting of interest accrual for every account
or a history-based accounting required in a variable rate setting. By
updating the indexes before each time that the rate changes, all users
have their interests accrued at once.

::: exmp
**Example 7**. _We expand on the previous example. Alice deposits $1000$
$\texttt{DAI}$ and, initially, the index $\lambda^S_{\texttt{DAI}}$ is
equal to $2$, so her supply balance $s_{\texttt{DAI}}(Alice)$ is
$1000\ /\ 2 = 500$.\
After 10 units of time, the index $\lambda^S_{\texttt{DAI}}$ becomes
$2 \cdot (1 + r^S_{\texttt{DAI}})^{10} = 2.20924$. So her underlying
balance is now:
$$s_{\texttt{DAI}}(Alice) \cdot \lambda^S_{\texttt{DAI}} = 500\,\cdot\,2.20924 = 1104.62\ \texttt{DAI}$$\_
:::

We first describe how the storage is managed internally, with the
so-called utils functions, before describing the main entry points made
accessible to the users.

### Utils Functions

#### Update rates:

The function $\texttt{update}\_r$ updates the rates for one market
depending on the utilization rate[^10].
$$\texttt{update}\_r: \Theta_\psi \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$

#### Update indexes:

The function $\texttt{update}\_\lambda$ updates exchanges rates between
users' balances and underlying tokens, depending on the rates since the
last update.
$$\texttt{update}\_\lambda: \Theta_\psi \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
Exchange rates are constantly updated before rates change.

#### Price oracle:

The oracle function $p$ returns the current price of an asset. It
corresponds to an estimated price in a fixed normalizing asset or
currency.

$$p : \Theta_\psi \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$$

The price oracle gives a way to compute the value of a particular asset.
Oracles are provided by a source that is external to the lending pool
and can be updated at regular intervals or according to the relative
change in value. Decentralization, trust, and reliability are essential
properties of the oracles, and the integrity of protocols such as the
PLFs depends on them[^11]. Popular oracles include the ChainLink
oracle [@chainlinkwpp] and the Uniswap oracle [@uniswap-oracle].

#### Borrowing capacity:

The function $\texttt{borrowing\_capacity}$ computes and returns the
borrowing capacity (in value) of a given user, which is the amount that
can be borrowed in addition to the user's current debt.
$$\texttt{borrowing\_capacity}: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ This function
first updates all the indexes it needs to access by calling the function
$\texttt{update}\_\lambda$ on the respective markets. It then computes
its result according to the following formula:

$$
\texttt{borrowing\_capacity}(a) =
\sum_{\theta \in \Theta_\psi} s_{\theta}(a) \cdot \lambda^S_{\theta} \cdot p_{\theta} \cdot F_{\theta} \,- \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_\psi} b_{\theta}(a) \cdot \lambda^B_{\theta} \cdot p_{\theta}
$$

### Main Entry Points {#external-plf}

In the following functions, the address $\overline{\psi}$ refers to the
address of the underlying protocol for loanable funds $\psi$.

#### Supply

[^12]**:** The `supply` function is used to deposit an amount
$\texttt{amount} \in \mathbb{R}_+$ of tokens $\theta \in \Theta_\psi$
into the protocol, which begins accumulating interests at the supply
rate.
$$\texttt{supply}: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
A standard implementation is given by:

    supply$_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda_\theta$()
        transfer$_\theta$(user, $\overline{\psi}$, amount)
        $s_\theta$(user) += amount / $\lambda^S_\theta$
        update_$r_\theta$()

Remark that because the `transfer` function can raise an error, some
calls to `supply` can also raise an error. It happens when the user has
insufficient funds, and we do not add a new transition in the transition
system in this case.

#### Borrow:

The `borrow` function is used to borrow an amount
$\texttt{amount} \in \mathbb{R}_+$ of tokens $\theta \in \Theta_\psi$
from the protocol.
$$\texttt{borrow}: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
An implementation enforcing the borrowing limit could look like the
following. Note that we should also ensure that the amount is less than
the available supply.

    borrow$_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda_\theta$()
        if amount * $p_\theta$ $\leq$ borrowing_capacity(user):
            transfer$_\theta$($\overline{\psi}$, user, amount)
            $b_\theta$(user) += amount / $\lambda^B_\theta$
            update_$r_\theta$()

#### Withdraw

[^13]**:** The `withdraw` function is used to withdraw previously
supplied assets to the protocol [^14].
$$\texttt{withdraw}: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
The following implementation makes sure that the amount withdrawn is
small enough such that the borrowing capacity is still greater than 0.

    withdraw$_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda_\theta$()
        if amount * $p_\theta$ * $F_\theta$ $\leq$ borrowing_capacity(user):
            transfer$_\theta$($\overline{\psi}$, user, amount)
            $s_\theta$(user) -= amount / $\lambda^S_\theta$
            update_$r_\theta$()

#### Repay:

The `repay` function is used to repay some accumulated debt to the
protocol.
$$\texttt{repay}: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
The following implementation enforces that users do not repay more than
their current debt (what has been borrowed plus the accrued interest).

    repay$_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda_\theta$()
        if amount $\leq b_\theta$(user) * $\lambda^B_\theta$:
            transfer$_\theta$(user, $\overline{\psi}$, amount)
            $b_\theta$(user) -= amount / $\lambda^B_\theta$
            update_$r_\theta$()

#### Liquidate:

The function `liquidate` liquidates a user's undercollateralized
position. A liquidator repays a part of the user's debt and receives a
part of the corresponding collateral backing the debt as an incentive.
This process aims to deleverage the position to a safe debt ratio.
$$\texttt{liquidate}: \Theta_\psi \times \Theta_\psi \times A \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$

A call to `liquidate($\theta_b$, $\theta_c$, user, liquidator, toRepay)`
requires the position of `user` to be undercollateralized. The `toRepay`
parameter is the amount of debt that the `liquidator` repays on behalf
of the `user`. This amount should not represent more than a fraction of
the borrowed tokens $\theta_b$. The close factor[^15] variable
`closeFactor` is a value between $0$ and $1$ representing this fraction.

The incentive for the liquidator is to be able to seize an amount
`toSeize` of the collateral tokens $\theta_c$ of the `user` that is
greater (in value) than the debt repaid. The ratio of the seized
collateral (in value) over the repaid debt (in value) is defined as the
`liquidationIncentive`[^16] parameter, a parameter greater than $1$.

Here is a possible implementation of the `liquidate` function:

    liquidate($\theta_b$, $\theta_c$, user, liquidator, toRepay):
        update_$\lambda_{\theta_b}$()
        update_$\lambda_{\theta_c}$()
        borrows = $b_{\theta_b}$(user) * $\lambda_{\theta_b}^B$
        if borrowing_capacity(user) < 0 and
               toRepay $\leq$ borrows * closeFactor:
            toSeize = (toRepay * $p_{\theta_b}$ / $p_{\theta_c}$) * liquidationIncentive
            repayOnBehalfOf$_{\theta_b}$(user, liquidator, toRepay)
            withdrawOnBehalfOf$_{\theta_c}$(user, liquidator, toSeize)

where `repayOnBehalfOf` and `withdrawOnBehalfOf` are the functions
`repay` and `withdraw` but with the `liquidator` acting as the `user`
for the transfer. Concretely, those functions take an additional
parameter `liquidator` used to replace the `user` in the underlying
transfer call of those functions. For instance, the `withdrawOnBehalfOf`
function changes the line

            transfer$_\theta$($\overline{\psi}$, user, amount)

into the line

            transfer$_\theta$($\overline{\psi}$, liquidator, amount)

The purpose of the `closeFactor` is to ensure that an
undercollateralized position does not get liquidated entirely. A
liquidator has to use multiple calls with smaller amounts, potentially
bringing the position gradually closer to a safe debt ratio.

We say that a position is insolvent when the value of the position's
debt is greater than the value of the position's collateral. In that
case, the borrower can leave with the borrowed assets as there is no
incentive to repay. Therefore, insolvent positions are a liability for
the protocol and should be avoided. Liquidations help to solve this
issue by targeting positions with a negative borrowing capacity, trying
to move them away from insolvency. A position is implied to be safe when
its borrowing capacity is positive. There is a gap between safe and
insolvent positions, which can be used as a metric to gauge how
dangerous a position is.

Suppose a position is at the limit of insolvency and liquidation
happens. Because of the `liquidationIncentive` factor, the liquidation
removes more collateral than borrowed assets. The position is now
insolvent. This example shows that liquidation does not always help put
the position back in the safe zone, and we want to know when it is the
case. To that end, let us first define the total value of the borrowed
assets $B$ by:
$$B = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_\psi} b_{\theta}(user) \cdot \lambda^B_{\theta} \cdot p_{\theta}$$
and the total value of the supplied assets $S$ by:
$$S = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_\psi} s_{\theta}(user) \cdot \lambda^S_{\theta} \cdot p_{\theta}$$

::: lem
**Lemma 1**. _The ratio _$\frac{B}{S}$_ decreases after a liquidation if
and only if this ratio was under
_$\frac{1}{\texttt{liquidationIncentive}}$_ before the liquidation._
:::

::: proof
_Proof._ After liquidation, the quantity $\frac{B}{S}$ decreases when:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{B}{S} &> \frac{\sum\limits_{\substack{\theta \in \Theta_\psi\\\theta \neq \theta_b}} b_{\theta}(user) \cdot \lambda^B_{\theta} \cdot p_{\theta} ~~+~~ (b_{\theta_b}(user) \cdot \lambda^B_{\theta_b} - \texttt{toRepay}) \cdot p_{\theta_b}}{\sum\limits_{\substack{\theta \in \Theta_\psi\\\theta \neq \theta_c}} s_{\theta}(user) \cdot \lambda^S_{\theta} \cdot p_{\theta} ~~+~~ (s_{\theta_c}(user) \cdot \lambda^S_{\theta_c} - \texttt{toSeize}) \cdot p_{\theta_c}}\\
&>\frac{B - \texttt{toRepay} \cdot p_{\theta_b}}{S - \texttt{toRepay} \cdot p_{\theta_b} \cdot \texttt{liquidationIncentive}}
\end{aligned}$$ which is equivalent to
$$- B \cdot \texttt{toRepay} \cdot p_{\theta_b} \cdot \texttt{liquidationIncentive} > - S \cdot \texttt{toRepay} \cdot p_{\theta_b}$$
and to $$\frac{B}{S} < \frac{1}{\texttt{liquidationIncentive}}$$ ◻
:::

In the following, we will write $\mathcal{T}$ for
$\frac{1}{\texttt{liquidationIncentive}}$. Suppose a user is
liquidatable with a ratio $\frac{B}{S}$ that is under $\mathcal{T}$.
Then, we know that after one liquidation, the ratio has decreased.
Either the user is back in the safe zone, or its position is still
liquidatable with a ratio that is still under $\mathcal{T}$. Consider
now multiple liquidations happening one after the other on the user's
position. Since there is an upper bound on the ratio $\frac{B}{S}$, we
know the user will run out of borrowed assets before running out of
collateral. So, if it is impossible to liquidate anymore, then either
there are no more borrowed assets to repay, or the position is not
liquidatable anymore. Either way, the result is a solvent position.

Suppose now that a user is liquidatable with a ratio over $\mathcal{T}$,
and consider multiple liquidations happening on its position. The ratio
will keep growing. Hence the user's position will stay liquidatable, and
the liquidations will stop only when the user lacks collateral assets.
The result is an insolvent position.

We conclude that it is preferable if liquidations happen before the
threshold $\mathcal{T}$. This threshold is itself before insolvency
(${\frac{B}{S} = 1}$).

# General description of Morpho {#morpho-description}

In this section, we describe the main functionalities of the Morpho
protocol. We start by detailing the internals of Morpho: first, the
storage variables of the contract, followed by its internal functions.
This allows us to describe then the external functions in more detail.
Those functions are the ones with which the users interact. We conclude
this section by proving the integrity of Morpho on the underlying pool.

Given one protocol for loanable funds $\psi$, the corresponding Morpho
protocol is noted $M_\psi$, and we refer to its contract address as
$\overline{M_\psi}$. We denote by $\Theta_{M_\psi}$ the subset of
$\Theta_\psi$ of tokens available on Morpho for the protocol $\psi$. For
the sake of this paper, the particular PLF on top of which Morpho is
built does not matter. For this reason, in the following, we set the
protocol to be a generic $\psi$, which allows us to omit it in the
notation. To remain concise, we use the subscript notation to denote a
function taking a token as an argument or omit it entirely when it can
be inferred from context.

## Storage

In order to follow debt and supply increase over time, user balances are
stored in *scaled units*, whose underlying value grows over time. Pool
credit lines evolve at pool rates, and Morpho reuses the index mechanism
of the underlying pool to track them. The protocol also has its own
peer-to-peer scaled unit and associated index.

#### Supplier balances:

Suppliers have two balances in Morpho. The pool supply balance
$s^{Pool}$ is in a unit that grows in underlying token value at $r^S$
speed and represents the supply that is deposited on the pool. The
matched or peer-to-peer supply balance $s^{P2P}$ grows at $r^{P2P}$
speed, and represents the matched peer-to-peer supply.
$$\begin{gathered}
s^{Pool}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \to A \to \mathbb{R}_+\\
s^{P2P}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \to A \to \mathbb{R}_+
\end{gathered}$$ The balances separation is the mechanism that makes
Morpho positions not fungible. The total supply balance of a user is the
sum of the two balances brought back to the underlying unit. Let us use
the following notations for the total supply balance of the user $u$:
$$\label{omega-S}  \omega^S_\theta(u) = s_\theta^{Pool}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^S + s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$

#### Borrower balances:

The same mechanism is used for borrower balances. The pool borrow
balance $b^{Pool}$ represents the on-pool debt and grows at $r^B$ speed,
while the matched or peer-to-peer borrow balance $b^{P2P}$ grows at
$r^{P2P}$ speed. $$\begin{gathered}
b^{Pool}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \to A \to \mathbb{R}_+\\
b^{P2P}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \to A \to \mathbb{R}_+\\
\end{gathered}$$ The total borrow balance of a user is the sum of the
two balances brought back to the underlying unit. Let us use the
following notations for the total borrow balance of the user $u$:
$$\label{omega-B} \omega^B_\theta(u) = b_\theta^{Pool}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B + b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$

#### Index:

The peer-to-peer index $\lambda^{P2P}$ is the exchange rate between
stored peer-to-peer balances in the peer-to-peer scaled unit and
underlying tokens. It constantly grows with time, at a speed that
depends on pool indexes evolution (see theorem
[2](#index-calc){reference-type="ref" reference="index-calc"}),
according to the interest rates model of Morpho. The amount of
underlying tokens corresponding to an amount in peer-to-peer scaled unit
is obtained by multiplying the scaled unit by the peer-to-peer index.
They are updated by $\text{update}\_\lambda^{P2P}$.
$$\lambda^{P2P}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \to \mathbb{R}_+$$

We denote by $r^{P2P}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ the
rate at which this index evolves. It is helpful to explain what is the
rate experienced by the users of Morpho, but it is not part of the
storage. Indeed, Morpho does not use the rates of the pool to compute
the indexes. Instead Morpho is only relying on the indexes, which makes
it less susceptible to rate manipulations, where an attacker triggers
functions on the underlying pool to use the difference of rates it
induces. Subsection [5](#index-mechanism){reference-type="ref"
reference="index-mechanism"} details the computations and estimation of
Morpho's rates.

## Utils functions

#### Matching functions:

These functions match (or unmatch) borrowers or suppliers, updating
their balances and returning the amount that was successfully matched
(or unmatched). Those functions are described in more detail in
subsection [4](#matching-engine){reference-type="ref"
reference="matching-engine"}. They are said internal because they are
accessible by Morpho itself only.

#### Update index:

The function $\texttt{update}\_\lambda^M$ updates both the pool indexes
and the peer-to-peer indexes of the given market.
$$\texttt{update}\_\lambda^M: \Theta_{M_\psi} \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
In order to update the pool indexes, this function calls
$\texttt{update}\_lambda$. See
section [5](#index-mechanism){reference-type="ref"
reference="index-mechanism"} for more details on the calculations
related to this function.

#### Borrowing capacity:

The function $\texttt{borrowing\_capacity}^M$ is a function that
computes and returns a given user's borrowing capacity (in value). This
amount can be borrowed in addition to the current debt.
$$\texttt{borrowing\_capacity}^M: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ This
function first updates all the indexes it needs to access by calling the
function $\texttt{update}\_\lambda^M$ on the respective markets. It then
computes its result according to the following formula:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \texttt{borrowing\_capacity}^M(a) \;\; = \;\;\; & \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_{M_\psi}} (s^{P2P}_\theta(a) \cdot \lambda^{P2P}_\theta + s^{Pool}_\theta(a) \cdot \lambda^S_\theta) \cdot p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \\
    - &\sum_{\theta \in \Theta_{M_\psi}} (b^{P2P}_\theta(a) \cdot \lambda^{P2P}_\theta + b^{Pool}_\theta(a) \cdot \lambda^B_\theta) \cdot p_\theta
\end{aligned}
$$

## Main Entry Points {#external-functions-morpho}

Morpho mirrors PLF's five main functions: supply, withdraw, borrow, and
repay for users, and liquidate for liquidators. From a user perspective,
the experience is the same as on PLFs.

From a high-level logic perspective, supply and borrow do a peer-to-peer
matching phase before finding or putting the remaining liquidity on the
pool. Withdraw and repay first try to remove some liquidity from the
pool before matching some users on the pool and finally unmatching
peer-to-peer matched users. Liquidate is a combination of repay and
withdraw. The order of operations has been chosen to maximize the
matched peer-to-peer liquidity, given the computation constraints.

### Supply

The `supply`$^M$ function is used to deposit funds to the Morpho
protocol, which starts accumulating interest at a potentially improved
rate compared to the underlying lending pool.
$$\texttt{supply}^M: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$

#### High-level description

1.  **Peer-to-peer supply:**

    1.  **Promote borrowers:** Morpho matches the incoming liquidity
        with some pool debt. The matching engine, described in more
        detail in section [4](#matching-engine){reference-type="ref"
        reference="matching-engine"}, tries to match as much debt as
        possible from pool borrowers. The liquidity is used to `repay`
        their debt on the pool.

2.  **Pool supply:**

    1.  **No matching process:** The remaining liquidity of the supplier
        is deposited on the underlying pool with a call to `supply`.
        There is no matching process here since the position is not
        peer-to-peer.

#### Formal description

\

    supply$^M_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda^M_\theta$()
        transfer$_\theta$(user, $\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

        // $\textbf{Peer-to-peer supply}$

        //// Promote borrowers
        matched = matchBorrowers$_\theta$(amount)
        $s^{P2P}_\theta$(user) += matched / $\lambda^{P2P}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        repay$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        // $\textbf{Pool supply}$

        $s^{Pool}_\theta$(user) += amount / $\lambda^S_\theta$
        supply$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

### Borrow

The `borrow`$^M$ function is used to borrow funds from the Morpho
protocol, potentially paying less interest compared to the underlying
lending pool.
$$\texttt{borrow}^M: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$

#### High-level description

1.  **Peer-to-peer borrow:**

    1.  **Promote suppliers:** Morpho matches the incoming demand with
        supply on the pool. The matching engine tries to match as much
        supply as possible from pool suppliers. The liquidity is taken
        from the pool suppliers with a `withdraw` on the underlying
        pool.

2.  **Pool borrow:**

    1.  **No matching process:** The remaining demand is met on the
        underlying pool with a call to `borrow`.

One may ask how Morpho ensures that its position is fairly
collateralized, considering that the borrowers' supply could already be
matched peer-to-peer in Morpho: see
theorem [1](#non-liquidation){reference-type="ref"
reference="non-liquidation"}.

#### Formal description

\

    borrow$^M_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda^M_\theta$()
        if amount * $p_\theta$ > borrowing_capacity$^M$(a):
            return
        initialAmount = amount

        // $\textbf{Peer-to-peer borrow}$

        //// Promote suppliers
        matched = matchSuppliers$_\theta$(amount)
        $b^{P2P}_\theta$(user) += matched / $\lambda^{P2P}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        withdraw$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        // $\textbf{Pool borrow}$

        $b^{Pool}_\theta$(user) += amount / $\lambda^B_\theta$
        borrow$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

        transfer$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, user, initialAmount)

### Withdraw

The `withdraw`$^M$ function is used to withdraw previously supplied
assets to the Morpho protocol.
$$\texttt{withdraw}^M: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$

#### High-level description

1.  **Pool withdraw:**

    1.  **No matching process:** If some of the user's liquidity is
        supplied on the pool, Morpho withdraws the corresponding part of
        its position on the underlying pool. It favors this option to
        maximize the user's matched peer-to-peer liquidity, thus, their
        capital efficiency. A `withdraw` on the underlying pool is
        performed.

2.  **Peer-to-peer withdraw:**

    1.  **Transfer withdraw:**

        1.  **Promote suppliers:** If the user is matched peer-to-peer,
            Morpho replaces him with other pool suppliers. It favors
            this option before the third one to maximize the total
            peer-to-peer liquidity. The matching engine tries to match
            as much liquidity as possible from pool suppliers. The
            liquidity is retrieved by a call to `withdraw` on the
            underlying pool.

    2.  **Breaking withdraw:**[]{#breaking-withdraw
        label="breaking-withdraw"}

        1.  **Demote borrowers:** Morpho breaks the peer-to-peer credit
            lines of the withdrawing user with the matched borrowers and
            reconnects them to the pool. The matching engine unmatches
            all the remaining debt from peer-to-peer borrowers. A
            `borrow` on the pool is performed to reconnect the borrowers
            to the pool. The borrowed assets are transferred to the
            withdrawer.

Once again, the non-liquidation
theorem [1](#non-liquidation){reference-type="ref"
reference="non-liquidation"} ensures that Morpho's position is fairly
collateralized.

#### Formal description

\

    withdraw$^M_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda^M_\theta$()
        if amount * $F_\theta$ * $p_\theta$ > borrowing_capacity$^M$(user):
            return
        initialAmount = amount

        // $\textbf{Pool withdraw}$

        withdrawnFromPool = min(amount, $s^{Pool}_\theta$(user) * $\lambda^{S}_\theta$)
        $s^{Pool}_\theta$(user) -= withdrawnFromPool / $\lambda^S_\theta$
        amount -= withdrawnFromPool
        withdraw$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, withdrawnFromPool)

        // $\textbf{Peer-to-peer withdraw}$

        //// $\textbf{Transfer withdraw}$

        // Promote suppliers
        matched = matchSuppliers$_\theta$(amount)
        $s^{P2P}_\theta$(user) -= matched / $\lambda^{P2P}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        withdraw$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        //// $\textbf{Breaking withdraw}$

        // Demote borrowers
        unmatched = unmatchBorrowers$_\theta$(amount)
        $s^{P2P}_\theta$(user) -= unmatched / $\lambda^S_\theta$
        borrow$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, unmatched)

        transfer$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, user, initialAmount)

### Repay

The `repay`$^M$ function is used to repay the accumulated debt to the
Morpho protocol.
$$\texttt{repay}^M: \Theta_\psi \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$

#### High-level description

1.  **Pool repay:**

    1.  **No matching process:** If some of the user's debt is borrowed
        from the pool, Morpho repays liquidity to the underlying pool.
        It favors this option to maximize the user's matched liquidity
        and capital efficiency. A `repay` is performed on the underlying
        pool.

2.  **Peer-to-peer repay:**

    1.  **Transfer repay:**

        1.  **Promote borrowers:** If the user is matched peer-to-peer,
            Morpho replaces the peer-to-peer credit lines with other
            pool borrowers. It favors this option before the third one
            to maximize the total peer-to-peer liquidity. The matching
            engine tries to match as much debt as possible from pool
            borrowers. A `repay` on the pool is performed to cut those
            borrowers' debt on the pool.

    2.  **Breaking repay:**[]{#breaking-repay label="breaking-repay"}

        1.  **Demote suppliers:** Morpho breaks the peer-to-peer credit
            lines of the repaying user with the remaining matched
            suppliers and deposits the unmatched liquidity on the
            underlying pool. The matching engine unmatches all the
            remaining liquidity from peer-to-peer suppliers. Morpho
            `supply` on the underlying pool to reconnect the suppliers
            to the pool.

#### Formal description

\

    repay$^M_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda^M_\theta$()
        if amount > $b^{P2P}_\theta$(user) * $\lambda^{P2P}$ + $b^{Pool}$(user) * $\lambda^B$:
            return
        transfer$_\theta$(user, $\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

        // $\textbf{Pool repay}$

        repaidOnPool = min(amount, $b^{Pool}_\theta$(user) * $\lambda^B_\theta$)
        $b^{Pool}_\theta$(user) -= repaidOnPool / $\lambda^B_\theta$
        amount -= repaidOnPool
        repay$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, repaidOnPool)

        // $\textbf{Peer-to-peer repay}$

        //// $\textbf{Transfer repay}$

        // Promote borrowers
        matched = matchBorrowers$_\theta$(amount)
        $b^{P2P}_\theta$(user) -= matched / $\lambda^{P2P}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        repay$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        //// $\textbf{Breaking repay}$

        // Demote suppliers
        unmatched = unmatchSuppliers$_\theta$(amount)
        $b^{P2P}_\theta$(user) -= unmatched / $\lambda^{P2P}_\theta$
        supply$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, unmatched)

### Liquidate

The liquidation on Morpho works the same way as liquidation on the
underlying pool. When a position of a user is not sufficiently
collateralized, a liquidator can repay part of the debt of the user and
seize a part of the collateral of the user.
$$\texttt{liquidate}^M: \Theta_\psi \times \Theta_\psi \times A \times A \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$$
Morpho uses the same values for the collateral factors $F$,
`closeFactor`, and `liquidationIncentive` as the ones used by the
underlying pool and the same oracle to retrieve the prices of the
borrowed and collateralized assets. The main difference with the
corresponding function on the pool is the calculation of the underlying
amount of supplied and borrowed assets. For each user, both pool and
peer-to-peer balances should be accounted. For example, the amount of
borrowed assets can be computed by:

    borrows = $b_{\theta_b}^{Pool}$(user) * $\lambda_{\theta_b}^B$ + b$_{\theta_b}^{P2P}$(user) * $\lambda_{\theta_b}^{P2P}$

## Non-liquidation theorem {#non-liquidation-section}

Let us first represent the positions on Morpho with a chart.

::: center
![image](assets/positions.png){height="6cm"}
:::

The bar on the left represents all the assets that are supplied through
Morpho (in an arbitrary common unit), and the bar on the right
represents all the assets borrowed through Morpho. In both cases, the
bottom part corresponds to the liquidity on the underlying pool because
it did not find a peer-to-peer match. Notice that the matched part of
the supply equals the matched part of the borrow.

The non-liquidation theorem states that the position of Morpho on the
underlying pool is not liquidatable. The intuition behind it comes from
considering safe positions as positions where the borrowed assets
represent a fraction, in value, of the supplied assets. Then, because
Morpho enforces that its users have safe positions (considering both
their assets on the pool and their matched assets) thanks to the
liquidation mechanism, the combination of pool borrow and peer-to-peer
borrow must also represent a fraction of the combination of the pool
supply and the peer-to-peer supply. In the previous chart, this is
visualized by estimating the whole borrow bar against the whole supply
bar. Removing the matched part, both in borrow and supply, only makes
this fraction smaller. This amounts to comparing the pool borrow against
the pool supply, which gives us the position of Morpho itself on the
underlying pool. The chart visualizes this by estimating the bottom of
the borrow bar against the bottom of the supply bar.

First, we present and prove the _pool position's integrity_ lemma and
the _peer-to-peer integrity_ lemma, which are helpful to prove the
non-liquidation theorem. Recall that $b_\theta$ et $s_\theta$ are the
borrow and supply balances on the underlying pool.

::: {#pool-positions-integrity .lem}
**Lemma 2** (Pool position's integrity). \*Morpho's position on the pool
is always the sum of the positions on the pool of all its users.

$$
\forall\theta\in\Theta_{M_\psi}, \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
    s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) = \sum_u s_\theta^{Pool}(u)\\
    b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) = \sum_u b_\theta^{Pool}(u)
\end{array}
\right.$$*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* We prove this lemma by induction.

#### Base case

At deployment, there is no user on Morpho:
$$\sum_u s^{Pool}(u)=\sum_u b^{Pool}(u)=0$$ And Morpho does not have any
position on the pool:
$$s(\overline{M_\psi}) = b(\overline{M_\psi}) = 0$$ So the equalities
are verified at the initial state.

#### Induction step

Let $\sigma_i\in\Sigma$ be a state where the equalities are verified.
Consider a transition to $\sigma_r\in\Sigma$. We only treat the case
where the transition is associated to a function call to
$\texttt{supply}$. Let $d=(\theta, u, x)\in D_{\texttt{supply}}$ be the
input for this transition. By now, we only consider the market $\theta$,
as others are untouched so that $\theta$ can be omitted as a subscript.

To remain concise, we write $\lambda^S$ for $\sigma_r(\lambda^S)$ and
$\lambda^B$ for $\sigma_r(\lambda^B)$. Consider first the **peer-to-peer
supply** step. Let $x^{\mu_B}$ be the total amount matched in underlying
by $\texttt{matchBorrowers}$ ($\texttt{matched}$ in the pseudo-code).
The total pool borrow amount is reduced by $x^{\mu_B} / \lambda^B$, and
the Morpho borrow position on the pool is reduced by
$x^{\mu_B}/ \lambda^B$.
$$\sum_u \sigma_r(b^{Pool}(u)) = \sum_u \sigma_i(b^{Pool}(u))- \frac{x^{\mu_B}}{\lambda^B}$$
$$\sigma_r(b(\overline{M_\psi})) = \sigma_i(b(\overline{M_\psi})) - \frac{x^{\mu_B}}{\lambda^B}$$
Consider also the **pool supply** step. The amount $x^{Pool}/\lambda^S$
is added to the supplier's pool balance with
$x^{Pool}=(x - \texttt{matched})$. The pool supply balance increases by
$x^{Pool}/\lambda^S$:
$$\sum_u \sigma_r(s^{Pool}(u)) = \sum_u \sigma_i(s^{Pool}(u)) + \frac{x^{Pool}}{\lambda^S}$$
$$\sigma_r(s(\overline{M_\psi})) = \sigma_i(s(\overline{M_\psi})) + \frac{x^{Pool}}{\lambda^S}$$
Yet, the equalities were verified at $\sigma_i$, so:
$$\sigma_r(s(\overline{M_\psi})) = \sum_u \sigma_r(s^{Pool}(u))$$
$$\sigma_r(b(\overline{M_\psi})) = \sum_u \sigma_r(b^{Pool}(u))$$ The
proof is similar for the other possible transitions. ◻

::: {#p2p-integrity .lem}
**Lemma 3** (Peer-to-peer integrity). *The sum of the suppliers'
peer-to-peer balances is always equal to the sum of the borrowers'
peer-to-peer balances.
$$\forall\theta\in\Theta_{M_\psi}, \sum_u s^{P2P}_\theta(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} = \sum_u b^{P2P}_\theta(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* We prove this lemma by induction and reuse the same notations
as for lemma [2](#pool-positions-integrity){reference-type="ref"
reference="pool-positions-integrity"}.

#### Base case

The equality is clearly verified at deployment.

#### Induction step

Let us prove that the invariant is preserved by a transition resulting
from calling the $\texttt{supply}$ function. Let
$d=(\theta, u, x)\in D_{\texttt{supply}}$ be the input for this function
call.

First, we notice that the equality is still verified after the index
update:
$$\sum_u s^{P2P}_\theta(u) \cdot \sigma_r(\lambda_\theta^{P2P}) = \sum_u b^{P2P}_\theta(u) \cdot \sigma_r(\lambda_\theta^{P2P})$$
And, to remain concise, we write $\lambda_\theta^{P2P}$ for
$\sigma_r(\lambda_\theta^{P2P})$.

Consider first the **peer-to-peer supply** step. Let $x^{\mu_B}$ be the
total amount matched in underlying by $\texttt{matchBorrowers}_\theta$
($\texttt{matched}$ in the pseudo-code). The peer-to-peer supply balance
of the supplier is increased by $x^{\mu_B} / \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$, and
the total of the peer-to-peer borrow balances is increased by
$x^{\mu_B} / \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$.
$$\sum_u \sigma_r(s^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} = \left( \sum_u \sigma_i(s^{P2P}(u)) + \frac{x^{\mu_B}}{\lambda^{P2P}_\theta} \right) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$
$$\sum_u \sigma_r(b^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} = \left( \sum_u \sigma_i(b^{P2P}(u)) + \frac{x^{\mu_B}}{\lambda^{P2P}_\theta} \right) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$
Remark also that the **pool supply** step does not change any user
peer-to-peer balance. Yet, the equality was verified at $\sigma_i$, so:
$$\sum_u \sigma_r(s^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} = \sum_u \sigma_r(b^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$
The proof is similar for the other possible transitions. ◻

We now turn to the non-liquidation theorem itself and its proof. This
theorem assumes a working liquidation system on Morpho: positions on
Morpho are liquidated as needed. In practice, for this assumption to
hold, it requires a reliable, and responsive off-chain monitoring of the
positions on Morpho.

**Theorem 1** (Non-liquidation). *If Morpho is equipped with a working
liquidation system, then Morpho's position on the pool is not
liquidatable.*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* From the peer-to-peer integrity
lemma [3](#p2p-integrity){reference-type="ref"
reference="p2p-integrity"}, we know that for each token $\theta$, the
following inequality stands:
$$\sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} = \sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}$$
We also get the following equalities from the pool position's integrity
lemma [2](#pool-positions-integrity){reference-type="ref"
reference="pool-positions-integrity"}:
$$\label{pool-positions-integrity-supply} s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) = \sum_u s_\theta^{Pool}(u)$$
$$\label{pool-positions-integrity-borrow} b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) = \sum_u b_\theta^{Pool}(u)$$
Recalling that $F_{\theta}$ represents the collateral factor, the
liquidation mechanism on Morpho ensures that, for each user $u$, we
have:
$$\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \omega^B_\theta(u) \leq \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot \omega^S_\theta(u)$$
so
$$\sum_u \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \omega^B_\theta(u) \leq \sum_u \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot \omega^S_\theta(u)$$
and
$$\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \sum_u \omega^B_\theta(u) \leq \sum_\theta  p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot \sum_u \omega^S_\theta(u)$$
Using the equalities [\[omega-S\]](#omega-S){reference-type="ref"
reference="omega-S"}, [\[omega-B\]](#omega-B){reference-type="ref"
reference="omega-B"} and then the equalities
[\[pool-positions-integrity-supply\]](#pool-positions-integrity-supply){reference-type="ref"
reference="pool-positions-integrity-supply"} and
[\[pool-positions-integrity-borrow\]](#pool-positions-integrity-borrow){reference-type="ref"
reference="pool-positions-integrity-borrow"}, we get: $$\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
\label{aggregated-pos}
\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot &(b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B + \sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}) \leq\\
&\sum_\theta  p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot (s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^S +\sum_us_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P})
\end{split}
\end{aligned}$$ For each $\theta$, $F_\theta$ less than or equal to $1$,
so we have: $$\begin{aligned}
 \sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} - F_\theta \cdot \sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}
    & = (1 - F_\theta) \cdot \sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} \\
    & \geq 0
\end{aligned}$$ This gives us the following: $$\label{collateral-bound}
    \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \left[\sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P} - F_\theta \cdot \sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{P2P}\right] \geq 0
$$

With [\[aggregated-pos\]](#aggregated-pos){reference-type="ref"
reference="aggregated-pos"} and
[\[collateral-bound\]](#collateral-bound){reference-type="ref"
reference="collateral-bound"}, we can conclude that:
$$\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B \leq \sum_\theta  p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi})\cdot \lambda_\theta^S$$

In other words, Morpho's position on the pool is not liquidatable. ◻

# Matching engine

The role of the matching engine is to create and break the peer-to-peer
credit lines of users. In this section, we will first explain how the
Morpho protocol makes use of the matching engine, and we will then
describe its high-level operation. The implementation is voluntarily
left abstract, as different ones could fit into the setting.

## Overview

Let us give an example before describing the inner workings of the
matching engine.

::: exmp
**Example 8**. _Let us say that the first $10$ users of Morpho are `DAI`
suppliers. They all supply $1000$ `DAI` tokens. Alice deposits some WETH
as collateral and borrows $5 000$ `DAI`. At that time, the matching
engine will look for suppliers to match and move $5$ of them
peer-to-peer. Alice and $5$ of the suppliers ended up matched
peer-to-peer, enjoying Morpho's rates._
:::

Note that it is possible for a user to be only partially matched
peer-to-peer. Such a user has a fraction of its liquidity matched
peer-to-peer, while the rest is on the pool.

Notice, moreover, that peer-to-peer credit lines are not really
associating borrowers with suppliers. Being matched peer-to-peer is a
state in which the user benefits from better rates than on the pool. And
the matching engine's role is to move users in and out of this state.

## Storage

User addresses are kept in four structures. Suppliers are in
$\texttt{suppliersInP2P}$ if they have matched supply and in
$\texttt{suppliersOnPool}$ if they have some supply on the pool. The
same applies to borrowers, with $\texttt{borrowersInP2P}$ and
$\texttt{borrowersOnPool}$.

In this yellow paper, we do not describe the data structures used for
the storage of the matching engine. We assume that those structures are
always up to date and that we have access to functions to retrieve the
suppliers and borrowers that are in those structures.

## Functions

### Getter functions

#### Get a peer-to-peer supplier:

This function returns a supplier that has matched peer-to-peer liquidity
in the market $\theta$.
$$\texttt{getSupplier}^{P2P}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \rightarrow A$$

#### Get a pool supplier:

This function returns a supplier that has liquidity on the pool in the
market $\theta$.
$$\texttt{getSupplier}^{Pool}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \rightarrow A$$

#### Get a peer-to-peer borrower:

This function returns a borrower that has matched peer-to-peer debt in
the market $\theta$.
$$\texttt{getBorrower}^{P2P}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \rightarrow A$$

#### Get a pool borrower:

This function returns a borrower that has debt on the pool in the market
$\theta$. $$\texttt{getBorrower}^{Pool}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \rightarrow A$$

### Matching functions

Let us describe the main functions of the matching engine:
`matchSuppliers`, `unmatchSuppliers`, `matchBorrowers`,
`unmatchBorrowers`. Those functions match (resp. unmatch) peer-to-peer
borrowers or peer-to-peer suppliers by looking for them in the
corresponding structure of the matching engine. They return the amount
that was successfully matched (resp. unmatched), and we assume that they
update the structures of the matching engine accordingly.

#### Match suppliers:

The function `matchSuppliers` matches pool suppliers until the amount
`amount` has been found or until there are no more pool suppliers.
$$\texttt{matchSuppliers}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$$
It updates some suppliers' positions in the structures of the matching
engine (`suppliersInP2P` and `suppliersOnPool`) and their balances
($s^{P2P}$, $s^{Pool}$) accordingly. Then it returns the matched amount.

As an example, the following pseudo-code loops through pool suppliers to
find the asked liquidity.

    matchSuppliers$_\theta$(amount):
        matched = 0
        while amount > 0 and suppliersOnPool != $\emptyset$:
            supplier = getSupplier$^{Pool}_\theta$()
            toMatch = min(amount, $s^{Pool}_\theta$(supplier) * $\lambda^S_\theta$)
            $s^{Pool}_\theta$(supplier) -= toMatch / $\lambda^S_\theta$
            $s^{P2P}_\theta$(supplier) += toMatch / $\lambda^{P2P}_\theta$
            amount -= toMatch
            matched += toMatch
        return matched

Remember that the data-structure `suppliersOnPool` is assumed to always
be up to date so we can expect the loop to terminate if there are no
more pool suppliers.

#### Unmatch suppliers:

The function `unmatchSuppliers` unmatches peer-to-peer suppliers, until
the amount `amount` has been found or until there are no more
peer-to-peer suppliers.
$$\texttt{unmatchSuppliers}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$$
It updates some suppliers' positions in the structures of the matching
engine (`suppliersInP2P` and `suppliersOnPool`) and their balances
($s^{P2P}$, $s^{Pool}$) accordingly. Then it returns the unmatched
amount.

#### Match borrowers:

The function `matchBorrowers` matches pool borrowers, until the amount
`amount` has been found or until there are no more pool borrowers.
$$\texttt{matchBorrowers}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$$
It updates some borrowers' positions in the structures of the matching
engine (`borrowersInP2P` and `borrowersOnPool`) and their balances
($b^{P2P}$, $b^{Pool}$) accordingly. Then it returns the matched amount.

#### Unmatch borrowers:

The function `unmatchBorrowers` unmatches peer-to-peer borrowers, until
the amount `amount` has been found or until there are no more
peer-to-peer borrowers.
$$\texttt{unmatchBorrowers}: \Theta_{M_\psi} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$$
It updates some borrowers' positions in the structures of the matching
engine (`borrowersInP2P` and `borrowersOnPool`) and their balances
($b^{P2P}$, $b^{Pool}$) accordingly. Then it returns the unmatched
amount.

# Interest rates mechanism {#index-mechanism}

In this section, we will go through all the Morpho mechanisms related to
interest rates. To this end, we first define the rates that we will
consider and then explain the different methods used to update the
indexes, including Morpho's approach. We conclude the section with a
proof of the rate improvement that Morpho is achieving.

## Interest rates {#interest_rates}

### Pool rates

Morpho's users that are not matched peer-to-peer are connected to the
pool (either via a deposit or a loan) and so experience pool rates.
Their credit lines evolve at pool rates, $r^S$ and $r^B$.

### Peer-to-peer theoretical rate

While users on the pool necessarily earn and pay the exact pool rates,
Morpho can freely choose the interest rates of its peer-to-peer matched
users. In order for the protocol to be a Pareto improvement of liquidity
pools, the chosen rate should always be in the rate spread of the pool.

For this first version of the protocol, it is a weighted arithmetic mean
of the supply and borrow rates of the pool, weighted by
$\alpha\in[0,1]$, the _peer-to-peer cursor_. The corresponding
peer-to-peer rate is: $$\begin{aligned}
    r^\alpha &= r^S + \alpha (r^B-r^S)\\
    &= (1-\alpha)r^S + \alpha r^B
\end{aligned}$$ For example, the so-called "mid-rate\"
($\alpha=\frac 1 2$) would be:
$$r^\alpha = r^{P2P} = \frac{r^S + r^B}{2}$$

### Peer-to-peer reserve rate {#reserve_rates}

In order to be sustainable in the long run, the protocol can charge a
fee for users and give it back to the Morpho DAO. In this section we
focus on the impact the fee has on Morpho's rates, an explanation of the
fee's accounting is given in
section [6.2.4](#repay-delta){reference-type="ref"
reference="repay-delta"}. The fee is only charged for users who really
benefit from the protocol improvements, so peer-to-peer matched
users[^17]. Thus, a difference between matched suppliers' and borrowers'
rates is introduced. Call $\rho$ the _reserve factor_, a quantity that
represents the proportion of the difference with the pool rate. The
resulting rates are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r^{\rho^S} &= r^\alpha - \rho(r^\alpha - r^S)\\
    &= (1-\rho) r^\alpha + \rho r^S\\
    &= (1-\rho)((1-\alpha)r^S + \alpha r^B) + \rho r^S\\
    &= (1 - \alpha + \rho\alpha)r^S + (\alpha - \rho\alpha) r^B
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r^{\rho^B} &= r^\alpha + \rho(r^B - r^\alpha)\\
    &= (1-\rho) r^\alpha + \rho r^B\\
    &= (1-\rho)((1-\alpha)r^S + \alpha r^B) + \rho r^B\\
    &= (1 - \rho - \alpha + \rho\alpha)r^S + (\rho + \alpha - \rho\alpha) r^B
\end{aligned}$$ The difference
$r^{\rho^B} - r^{\rho^S} = \rho (r^B - r^s)$ is the percentage $\rho$ of
the spread $r^B - r^S$ of the pool rates.

## Indexes

### Generalities

Let $(r_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of rates and
$(\lambda_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be the corresponding sequence of
indexes. Let $(t_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ be the increasing sequence of
times when the index is updated. We assume that $t_0 = 0$. Let
$t_{current}$ be an update time with $current >0$, we write
$t_{last} = t_{current-1}$ and $\Delta t = t_{current} - t_{last}$. We
detail the indexes evolution in the following three different settings,
with the sequence $(\lambda_i)$ being either $(\lambda_i^{lin})$,
$(\lambda_i^{comp})$ or $(\lambda_i^{recomp})$.

#### With linear interests.

The formula of index evolution in one step is given by:
$$\forall t \in \mathbb{N}, \lambda_{t+1}^{lin} = \lambda_t^{lin} + \lambda_0^{lin} \cdot r_t$$
By recurrence, we can prove that:
$$\forall t \in \mathbb{N}, \lambda_t^{lin} = \lambda_0^{lin} (1 + \sum_{k < t} r_k)$$
Assuming that $(r_i)$ is constant on
$\llbracket t_{last}, t_{current}\llbracket$, the following formula
gives a way to update the indexes in the case of linear interests:
$$\lambda_{t_{current}}^{lin} = \lambda_{t_{last}}^{lin} + \Delta t \cdot \lambda_0^{lin} \cdot r_{t_{last}}$$

#### With compounded interests.[^18] {#with-compounded-interests. .unnumbered}

The formula of index evolution in one step is given by:
$$\forall t \in \mathbb{N}, \lambda_{t+1}^{comp} = \lambda_t^{comp} + \lambda_t^{comp} \cdot r_t$$
By recurrence, we can prove that:
$$\forall t \in \mathbb{N}, \forall t'\in\mathbb{N}, t'<t, \lambda_t^{comp} = \lambda_{t'}^{comp} \prod_{t' \leq i<t} (1 + r_i)$$
Assuming that $(r_i)$ is constant on
$\llbracket t_{last}, t_{current}\llbracket$[^19], the following formula
gives a way to update the index in the case of compounded interests:
$$\lambda_{t_{current}}^{comp} = \lambda_{t_{last}}^{comp} (1+r_{t_{last}})^{\Delta t}$$

#### With re-compounded linear interests.[^20]: {#with-re-compounded-linear-interests. .unnumbered}

The formula of index evolution in one step is given by:
$$\forall t \in \mathbb{N}, \lambda_{t+1}^{recomp} = \lambda_t^{recomp} + \lambda_{t'}^{recomp} \cdot r_t$$
where $t'$ is the last update time before $t$. By recurrence, we can
prove that, for $s, e \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $s \leq e$:
$$\lambda_{t_e}^{recomp} = \lambda_{t_s}^{recomp} \prod_{s \leq i < e} \left(1 + \sum_{t_i \leq j <t_{i+1}} r_j \right)$$
And, in particular:
$$\lambda_{t_{current}}^{recomp} = \lambda_{t_{last}}^{recomp} \left(1 + \sum_{t_{last}\leq j <t_{current}} r_j \right)$$
Assuming that $(r_j)$ is constant on
$\llbracket t_{last}, t_{current}\llbracket$, the following formula
gives a way to update the index in the case of re-compounded interests:
$$\lambda_{t_{current}}^{recomp} = \lambda_{t_{last}}^{recomp} \left(1+ \Delta t \cdot r_{t_{last}}\right)$$

### Indexes calculations on Morpho

Let us define the weights $\beta^S$ and $\beta^B$, with
$\beta^B + \beta^S = 1$ such that the Morpho rate $r$ is expected to be
$\beta^S r^S + \beta^B r^B$. These weights define where the Morpho rate
lies in the spread. For example, if $\beta^S$ is close to $1$, $r$
should be close to the pool supply rate $r^S$. $\lambda$ denotes the
index associated to $r$, allowing us to generalize the results of this
subsection. In particular, we will be able to apply the theorem
[2](#index-calc){reference-type="ref" reference="index-calc"} to the
rates $r^{\alpha}$, $r^{\rho^S}$, and $r^{\rho^B}$ defined in
subsection [5.1](#interest_rates){reference-type="ref"
reference="interest_rates"} and to the rates $r^{\gamma^S}$ and
$r^{\gamma^B}$ defined in
subsection [6.3](#impact-rates){reference-type="ref"
reference="impact-rates"}.

As previously stated, Morpho does not use the pool rates to update its
indexes but instead uses the pool indexes' growth. The following theorem
gives the formula that is used to update Morpho's indexes in that way.
Notice that the pool rates do not appear in the formula given by the
theorem.

We assume that the underlying pool uses compounded interests to update
its indexes.

::: {#index-calc .thm}
**Theorem 2**. *Let $\beta^S\in\mathbb{R}_+$, $\beta^B\in\mathbb{R}_+$
with $\beta^S+\beta^B=1$ and let $(\lambda_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a
sequence such that:
$$\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, \forall t'\in\mathbb{N}, t>t' \Rightarrow \lambda_t = \lambda_{t'} \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1+ \beta^S r^S_i + \beta^B r^B_i)$$
We have, with $R_{t',t}$ the maximum of the rates $r^B_i$ for
$i \in \llbracket t', t \llbracket$:
$$\forall t\in\mathbb{N}, \forall t'\in\mathbb{N}, t>t' \Rightarrow \lambda_t = \lambda_{t'} \left(\beta^S\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + \beta^B\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)$$*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $t\in\mathbb{N}, t'\in\mathbb{N}, t'<t$. The precision of
the approximation given by this theorem relies on the fact that the
rates are small numbers, and thus the maximum of those rates $R_{t',t}$
is small too.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \lambda_{t} &= \lambda_{t'} \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1+\beta^S r^S_i + \beta^B r^B_i)\\
    &= \lambda_{t'} \left(1+\sum_{t'\leq i<t}(\beta^S r^S_i + \beta^B r^B_i) + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right) \\
    &= \lambda_{t'} \left(1+ \beta^S \sum_{t'\leq i<t} r^S_i + \beta^B \sum_{t'\leq i<t} r^B_i + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)
\end{aligned}$$ On the other hand, we have: $$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} &= \frac{\lambda_0 \prod_{0 \leq i<t} (1 + r^S_i)}{\lambda_0 \prod_{0 \leq i<t'} (1 + r^S_i)}\\
    &= \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1 + r^S_i)\\
    &= 1+\sum_{t'\leq i<t} r^S_i + O(R_{t',t}^2)\\
    &= 1+\sum_{t'\leq i<t} r^S_i + O(R_{t',t}^2)
\end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} &= \frac{\lambda_0 \prod_{0 \leq i<t} (1 + r^B_i)}{\lambda_0 \prod_{0 \leq i<t'} (1 + r^B_i)}\\
    &= \prod_{t'\leq i < t} (1 + r^B_i)\\
    &= 1+\sum_{t'\leq i<t} r^B_i + O(R_{t',t}^2)
\end{aligned}$$ so $$\begin{aligned}
    \lambda_{t} &= \lambda_{t'} \left(1+ \beta^S(\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}}-1 + O(R_{t',t}^2)) + \beta^B(\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}}-1 + O(R_{t',t}^2)) + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)\\
    &= \lambda_{t'} \left(1+ \beta^S\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + \beta^B\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} - \beta^S - \beta^B + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)\\
    &= \lambda_{t'} \left(\beta^S\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + \beta^B\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)
\end{aligned}$$ ◻
:::

Notice that if the underlying pool uses linear interests, then the
approximation given by the theorem is an exact calculation. Let us now
explain how the indexes are updated in Morpho, starting with the most
straighforward case where there is no reserve factor.

#### Without reserve factor:

Let $(u_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ be the sequences of times when the index is
updated on Morpho. Let $(\lambda^S_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ and
$(\lambda^B_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be the supply and borrow indexes on
the pool. Let $(\lambda^\alpha_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be Morpho's
indexes. This notation is introduced to take into account the
peer-to-peer cursor $\alpha$.

####  {#section .unnumbered}

Let $t\in\mathbb{N}, t'\in\mathbb{N}$ with $t'<t$. We have:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \lambda^\alpha_t &= \lambda^\alpha_{t'} \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1+r^\alpha_i)\\
    &= \lambda^\alpha_{t'} \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1+(1-\alpha)r^S_i + \alpha r^B_i)
\end{aligned}$$ With theorem [2](#index-calc){reference-type="ref"
reference="index-calc"} ($\beta^S = (1-\alpha)$, $\beta^B = \alpha$):
$$\begin{aligned}
    \lambda^\alpha_{t} &= \lambda^\alpha_{t'} \left((1-\alpha)\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + \alpha\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)\\
    &\approx \lambda^\alpha \left((1-\alpha)\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + \alpha\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} \right)
\end{aligned}$$ This last formula can be used to update the indexes.

#### With reserve factor:

Now we take into account the reserve factor. As we have seen in
paragraph [5.1.3](#reserve_rates){reference-type="ref"
reference="reserve_rates"}, we want the rates experienced by users to
be: $$\begin{aligned}
    r^{\rho^S} &= (1 - \alpha + \rho \alpha) r^S + (\alpha - \rho\alpha) r^B\\
    r^{\rho^B} &= (1 - \rho - \alpha + \rho\alpha)r^S + (\rho + \alpha - \rho\alpha) r^B
\end{aligned}$$ We denote the corresponding index rates by
$(\lambda^{\rho^S}_i)_{i \in\mathbb{N}}$ and
$(\lambda^{\rho^B}_i)_{i \in\mathbb{N}}$. This notation is introduced to
take into account the reserve factor (in addition to the peer-to-peer
cursor).

####  {#section-1 .unnumbered}

Let $t\in\mathbb{N}, t'\in\mathbb{N}$ with $t'<t$. We have:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \lambda^{\rho^S}_t &= \lambda^{\rho^S}_{t'} \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1+r^{\rho^S}_i)\\
    &= \lambda^{\rho^S}_{t'} \prod_{t'\leq i<t} (1+ (1-\alpha+\rho\alpha)r^S_i + (\alpha - \rho\alpha)r^B_i)
\end{aligned}$$ With theorem [2](#index-calc){reference-type="ref"
reference="index-calc"} ($\beta^S=(1-\alpha+\rho\alpha)$,
$\beta^B=(\alpha-\rho\alpha)$): $$\label{rho-rate-supply-update}
\lambda^{\rho^S}_{t} = \lambda^{\rho^S}_{t'} \left((1-\alpha+\rho\alpha)\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (\alpha-\rho\alpha)\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)
$$

Similarly, for the borrow indexes, we have:

$$
\label{rho-rate-borrow-update}
    \lambda^{\rho^B}_{t} = \lambda^{\rho^B}_{t'} \left((1-\rho - \alpha+\rho\alpha)\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (\rho + \alpha-\rho\alpha)\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} + O(R_{t',t}^2)\right)
$$

When considering the reserve factor, we can use those two results to
update the indexes. Those formulas are efficient computations that we
can use in the code.

## Peer-to-peer inequality

Notice that the _peer-to-peer integrity_ lemma no longer holds because
of the reserve factor. However, we can still prove that the sum of the
suppliers' peer-to-peer balances is always equal to the sum of the
borrowers' peer-to-peer balances plus the unpaid reserve in underlying
(which we will note $P$).

::: lem
**Lemma 4**.
_$$\forall\theta\in\Theta, \sum_u s^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{\rho^S} + P*\theta = \sum_u b^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda*\theta^{\rho^B}$$\_
:::

We have as a direct corrolary:

::: {#p2p-inequality .lem}
**Lemma 5**. _(Peer-to-peer inequality)
$$\forall\theta\in\Theta, \sum_u s^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{\rho^S} \leq \sum*u b^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda*\theta^{\rho^B}$$\_
:::

This is enough to prove the non-liquidation theorem
([1](#non-liquidation){reference-type="ref"
reference="non-liquidation"}).

## Rates calculations and Pareto improvement

We show in this subsection that Morpho rates are improved compared to
the ones on the underlying pool. To that end, we assume that the initial
peer-to-peer index rates are between the supply index rate $\lambda^S$
and the borrow index rate $\lambda^B$ and show that index rates stay in
this range. An exact calculation of the rates is provided, leading to an
estimate of those rates that is easier to understand and compute.

Let $(\lambda_i)$ be a sequence only changing at $(u_n)$ (those
represent the update times) such that, for $t = u_n$, we have:
$$\lambda_t = \lambda_{u_{n-1}} \left( \beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} + \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}} \right)$$
with $\beta^S + \beta^B = 1$. This condition holds for
$(\lambda^\alpha_i)$, $(\lambda^{\rho^S}_i)$, $(\lambda^{\rho^B}_i)$,
and even $(\lambda^S_i)$ and $(\lambda^B_i)$. Remember that the weights
$\beta^S$ and $\beta^B$ can be computed from the peer-to-peer cursor
$\alpha$ and the reserve factor $\rho$ of Morpho.

_Proof._ We prove this theorem by induction. We assume that it holds at
$0$, so we only need to prove that it holds at $t = u_n$, knowing that:
$$\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}} \leq \lambda_{u_{n-1}} \leq \lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}$$
Since the supply rate is less than the borrow rate, we have
$$\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} \leq \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}$$
The average of these rates should be in the middle, so:

$$
\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} \leq
 \beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} + \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}
\leq \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}$$ By using the induction
hypothesis, we get
$$\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}} \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} \leq
\lambda_{u_{n-1}} ( \beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} + \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}})
\leq \lambda^B_{u_{n-1}} \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}$$ which
is what we wanted to prove:
$$\lambda^S_t \leq \lambda_t \leq \lambda^B_t$$ ◻

### Rates improvement

Let $u_{n-1}$ be the last time the index rates have been updated. With
$\Delta t = t - u_{n-1}$, let $\bar{r}^S_t$ be the rate such that:
$$(1 + \bar{r}^S_t)^{\Delta t} = \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}}$$
The rate $\bar{r}^S_t$ is formally defined by:
$$\bar{r}^S_t = \left( \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} \right)^{1/ \Delta t} - 1$$
The rate $\bar{r}^S_t$ is an "average", meaning that it is the rate at
which the index rate $\lambda^S$ would grow if its rate were constant
between $u_{n-1}$ and $t$. In other words, we can consider that a
supplier has benefited from this average rate for the whole period
$\Delta t$. We define $\bar{r}^S_t$ and $\bar{r}_t$ in the same way:
$$(1 + \bar{r}^B_t)^{\Delta t} = \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}$$
$$(1 + \bar{r}_t)^{\Delta t} = \beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}}
+ \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}
$$

So, the rate experienced by matched users of Morpho between the update
times $u_{n-1}$ and $t = u_n$ is given by:

$$
\bar{r}_t = (\beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}}
+ \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}})^{1 / \Delta t} - 1
$$

::: thm
**Theorem 4**. _The experienced rate $\bar{r}_t$ is in the spread
$[\bar{r}^S_t, \bar{r}^B_t]$._
:::

::: proof
_Proof._ Define $f: \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for
$x \geq 0$, $f(x) = (1 + x)^{1 / \Delta t} - 1$. We know that

$$
\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} \leq
 \beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} + \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}
\leq \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}$$ and since $f$ is growing,
we have: $$f(\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}}-1) \leq
f(\beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} + \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}} - 1)
\leq f(\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}} - 1)$$ so
$$\bar{r}^S_t \leq \bar{r}_t \leq \bar{r}^B_t$$ ◻
:::

This shows that Morpho provides better rates than the underlying pool.

### Morpho rate calculation and estimate

We want to know where the average rate lies between the supply and the
borrow rates. This amounts to calculating $\beta^S_r$ and $\beta^B_r$
such that $\beta^S_r + \beta^B_r = 1$ and such that
$\bar{r}_t = \beta^S_r \bar{r}^S_t + \beta^B_r \bar{r}^B_t$. Thus, the
exact calculation is given by:
$$\beta^S_r = \frac{\bar{r}_t - \bar{r}^B_t}{\bar{r}^S_t - \bar{r}^B_t}$$
and by $\beta^B_r = 1 - \beta^S_r$. This way, any user with access to
the underlying pool rates can calculate where the Morpho rate lies
between the supply and the borrow rates. If the quantities
$\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}}$ and
$\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}$ are small, we can use the
following estimation of the function $f$ for small values of $x$
$$\begin{aligned}
f(x) &\approx f(0) + f'(0) \cdot x\\
&\approx \Delta t \cdot x
\end{aligned}$$ and estimate $$\begin{aligned}
  \beta^S_r &= \frac{\bar{r}_t - \bar{r}^B_t}{\bar{r}^S_t - \bar{r}^B_t}\\
            &\approx \frac{\Delta t \cdot  (\beta^S \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} + \beta^B \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}})-
              \Delta t \cdot \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}}{\Delta t \cdot \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{u_{n-1}}} -
              \Delta t \cdot \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{u_{n-1}}}}\\
            &\approx \beta^S
\end{aligned}
$$

We also have $\beta^B_r \approx \beta^B$. Notice that this approximation
is independent of time. This gives a simple rule of thumb to know where
the Morpho rate lies between the borrow rate and the supply rate.

We have seen that the peer-to-peer rate can be computed precisely or
estimated given the appropriate weights $\beta^B$ (and $\beta^S$).
Notably, for the peer-to-peer supply rate taking into account the
reserve factor, we have $\beta^B = \alpha - \rho \alpha$. This is useful
to compute the experienced rate of a user with both a position on the
pool and in peer-to-peer. The rate experienced by the user is thus an
average of the computed peer-to-peer rate and the pool rate (either
$r^B$ or $r^S$), weighted by their pool and peer-to-peer balances.

# Peer-to-peer delta mechanism {#delta-mechanism}

Matching and unmatching users peer-to-peer is not a constant time
operation, and large transactions may not find sufficient liquidity
given the alloted resources. The delta mechanism is designed to solve
this issue.

Definining a concrete limit on the computation can be done in different
settings: it could be done to save CPU time, to limit the total power
used, or to prove that a particular implementation terminates by first
adding a \"fuel parameter\". Using this limit, we can then be decide at
any point if the matching engine should stop. In this paper we apply the
delta mechanism to limit the gas usage in the EVM [@buterin2014next],
but the same mechanism could be used in the contexts mentioned above.

This section first gives a high-level description of the problem and of
the delta mechanism as a solution, which allows us to derive the impact
it has on the rates. We then turn to a more detailed description of how
this is implemented, and we conclude by updating the protocol formalism
to take into account the delta mechanism.

## Description

Finding a match can be an intensive computation, and we explain here how
we can stop the matching engine early to mitigate its cost. It amounts
to finding the missing liquidity when the matching engine did not return
a high enough matched amount.

When supplying or borrowing, if not enough liquidity could be found, we
already have the pool fallback: Morpho fills the rest of the order with
a supply or borrow on the pool, and the user balances are updated
accordingly.

For withdrawing and repaying, since these functions end with a matching
part that is expected to find the asked liquidity, we need to come up
with another fallback. Indeed, we would need to modify the balance of
the unmatched users and the data-structures states, but we cannot
because of the computation constraint. The idea is to continue the
breaking step (see [breaking withdraw](#breaking-withdraw) and [breaking
repay](#breaking-repay)) by increasing the position of Morpho on the
pool accordingly. This means that the rate experienced by suppliers
should decrease in case of a breaking repay, and the rate experienced by
borrowers should increase in case of a breaking withdraw. The delta
mechanism is designed to account for this change.

#### {#section-2 .unnumbered}

To summarize, the peer-to-peer delta mechanism works as follows: we
operate the pool fallback to fill the order, even if we cannot unmatch
enough peer-to-peer users. It introduces a difference[^21] between the
peer-to-peer liquidity evolving at Morpho's rates and the sum of
peer-to-peer balances of users on this side of the market. In order to
remedy this, the rates experienced by all peer-to-peer users are
adapted.

Concretely, consider the case where one user is withdrawing (resp.
repaying), and its liquidity is matched peer-to-peer. Suppose also that
there is insufficient liquidity from suppliers (resp. borrowers) on the
pool to replace him. So the peer-to-peer credit lines will be broken,
and peer-to-peer borrowers (resp. suppliers) will be reconnected to the
pool. If the matching engine cannot find enough liquidity in this step,
then Morpho borrows (resp. supplies) all the remaining asked liquidity
on the pool. This means that all peer-to-peer borrowers (resp.
suppliers) now have a part of their borrow (resp. supply) on the pool
and now get a worse rate.

####

Let $S^{P2P}$ and $S^{Pool}$ be the total supply of Morpho users
peer-to-peer and on the pool: $$\begin{aligned}
S^{P2P} &= \sum_{a\in A} s^{P2P}(a)\\
S^{Pool} &= \sum_{a\in A} s^{Pool}(a)
\end{aligned}$$ Similarly, let $B^{P2P}$ and $B^{Pool}$ be the total
borrows: $$\begin{aligned}
B^{P2P} &= \sum_{a\in A} b^{P2P}(a)\\
B^{Pool} &= \sum_{a\in A} b^{Pool}(a)
\end{aligned}$$

Recall that $s(a)$ and $b(a)$ represent the supply and borrow balances
of user $a$ on the pool. Those quantities are defined independently of
Morpho in subsection [2.2](#plf){reference-type="ref" reference="plf"}.
The peer-to-peer supply delta $\delta^S$ and the peer-to-peer borrow
delta $\delta^B$ are defined as follows: $$\begin{aligned}
S^{Pool} + \delta^S &= s(\overline{M_\psi}) \\
B^{Pool} + \delta^B &= b(\overline{M_\psi})
\end{aligned}$$

These notations are represented on the following chart, showing only the
case of the borrow delta for concision.

There are three situations in which Morpho deals with the delta
mechanism.

#### Delta increase

After a breaking withdraw or breaking repay, if not enough peer-to-peer
users could be unmatched, we increase the delta by the missing
liquidity.

#### Delta matching

When new liquidity comes (in a supply or borrow), the delta of the other
side of the market is "matched", reducing it.

#### Delta reduction

When some peer-to-peer liquidity exits, the corresponding delta is
reduced. For example, withdrawing peer-to-peer matched liquidity will
first decrease the supply delta.

## Implementation

####

To ensure that transactions gas costs are bounded, we make sure that the
gas used for matching does not exceed a predefined limit. The predefined
limit, written `maxGasForMatching`, accounts for all the gas used by the
matching engine during one transaction. When a matching function does
not have enough gas left to execute, it can return early and return a
matched amount lower than the asked liquidity. Since other parts of the
code also have a bounded gas cost, we know that Morpho's operations'
overall gas costs are bounded. This way, Morpho can scale as more users
enter the different markets.

The matching engine is not mandatory for operations to succeed. Thus we
introduce the possibility for Morpho users to choose the
`maxGasForMatching` parameter, that is how much gas they are ready to
pay for matching engine in `supply$^M$` and `borrow$^M$` functions.

This cannot be used in `withdraw$^M$`, `repay$^M$`, and `liquidate$^M$`.
Indeed, for these functions, there is no economic incentive to match and
unmatch more users (in fact, there is an incentive not to do so because
of the gas cost). So, for these functions, the maximum gas to be used in
matching is fixed. It may be 0 for `liquidate$^M$` to reduce
liquidations gas cost.

The matching functions implementations need to be modified to consider
the gas constraints so that they stop executing when there is no gas
left for matching. More specifically, the matching functions described
in section [4](#matching-engine){reference-type="ref"
reference="matching-engine"} now take an additional parameter and return
an additional value: respectively, the gas available for the matching
engine before the call of the function and the gas left after its
execution. Consider, for example, the function `matchSuppliers`, updated
to take into account the gas limits
$$\texttt{matchSuppliers}: \Theta_{M_p} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{N}$$
A call such as `matchSuppliers$_\theta$(amount, gasAtStart)` will match
suppliers and return a pair `(matched, gasLeft)`, where `matched` is the
liquidity that has been matched, and `gasLeft` is the gas left after the
call, a lower value than `gasAtStart`. Notice that the gas parameter is
simply an integer here, as in Ethereum. As before, `matched` is lower
than `amount`, the asked liquidity. The matched amount can also be lower
than `amount` when there is not enough gas to look for the asked
liquidity.

####

We also need to track the deltas in new storage variables:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \delta^S\in\Theta_\psi &\to \mathbb{R}_+\\
    \delta^B\in\Theta_\psi &\to \mathbb{R}_+
\end{aligned}$$ for respectively the peer-to-peer supply delta and the
peer-to-peer borrow delta. Their values are in pool scaled units because
they evolve at pool rates. Also, to calculate the share of the delta and
update the indexes, we need to track the total amounts matched
peer-to-peer. To do so, we introduce two new variables to Morpho's
contract storage: $$S^{P2P}\in \Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+$$ for the
total peer-to-peer supply amount and
$$B^{P2P}\in\Theta_\psi \to \mathbb{R}_+$$ for the total peer-to-peer
borrow amount. Finally, we define the peer-to-peer supply index that
takes into account the delta mechanism (on top of the index cursor and
the reserve factor): $$\lambda^{\gamma^S}$$ Similarly, we have the
peer-to-peer borrow index taking into account the delta mechanism:
$$\lambda^{\gamma^B}$$
Subsection [6.3](#impact-rates){reference-type="ref"
reference="impact-rates"} details how those peer-to-peer indexes are
updated.

####

Let us rewrite Morpho's main functions with the implementation of the
delta mechanism.

### Supply

#### High-level description

1.  **Peer-to-peer supply:**

    1.  **Match peer-to-peer borrow delta:** Morpho "matches" the user
        with the peer-to-peer borrow delta and reduces it. This is done
        first to keep the delta as low as possible. A `repay` on the
        pool is performed to reduce the surplus of borrow on the pool
        induced by the peer-to-peer borrow delta. Note that this allows
        responsive users to skip the queue of users on the pool and be
        instantly matched peer-to-peer.

    2.  **Peer-to-peer supply:** Morpho matches the incoming liquidity
        with some debt on the pool. The matching engine tries to match
        as much debt as possible from pool borrowers. A `repay` on the
        pool is performed to disconnect the matched borrowers from it.

2.  **Pool supply:**

    1.  **No matching process:** The remaining liquidity is deposited on
        the underlying pool. There is no matching process here.

#### Formal description

 \

    supply$^M_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda^M_\theta$()
        transfer$_\theta$(user, $\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

        //// Match peer-to-peer borrow delta
        matched = min($\delta^B_\theta$ * $\lambda^B_\theta$, amount)
        $\delta^B_\theta$ -= matched / $\lambda^B_\theta$
        $s^{P2P}_\theta$(user) += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_S}_\theta$
        $S^{P2P}$ += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_S}_\theta$

        $B^{P2P}$ += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        repay$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        // $\textbf{Pool supply}$

        $s^{Pool}_\theta$(user) += amount / $\lambda^S_\theta$
        supply$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

### Borrow

#### High-level description

1.  **Peer-to-peer borrow:**

    1.  **Match peer-to-peer supply delta:** Morpho "matches" the user
        with the peer-to-peer supply delta and reduces it. This is done
        first to keep the delta as low as possible. A `withdraw` on the
        pool is performed to reduce the surplus of supply on the pool
        induced by the peer-to-peer supply delta. Note that this allows
        responsive users to skip the queue of users on the pool and be
        instantly matched peer-to-peer.

    2.  **Promote suppliers:** Morpho matches the incoming demand with
        some supply on the pool. The matching engine tries to match as
        much liquidity as possible from pool suppliers. A `withdraw` on
        the pool is performed to disconnect the matched suppliers from
        it.

2.  **Pool borrow:**

    1.  **No matching process:** The remaining demand is met on the
        underlying pool with a call to `borrow`.

#### Formal description

 \

    borrow$^M_\theta$(user, amount):
        update_$\lambda^M_\theta$()
        if amount * $p_\theta$ > borrowing_capacity$^M$(a):
            return
        initialAmount = amount

        // $\textbf{Peer-to-peer borrow}$

        //// Match peer-to-peer supply delta
        matched = min($\delta^S_\theta$ * $\lambda^S_\theta$, amount)
        $\delta^S_\theta$ -= matched / $\lambda^S_\theta$
        $b^{P2P}_\theta$(user) += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta$
        $B^{P2P}$ += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        withdraw$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        //// Promote suppliers
        (matched, _) = matchSuppliers$_\theta$(amount, maxGasForMatching)
        $b^{P2P}_\theta$(user) += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta$
        $S^{P2P}$ += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_S}_\theta$
        $B^{P2P}$ += matched / $\lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta$
        amount -= matched
        withdraw$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, matched)

        $b^{Pool}_\theta$(user) += amount / $\lambda^B_\theta$
        borrow$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, amount)

        transfer$_\theta$($\overline{M_\psi}$, user, initialAmount)

### Withdraw

#### High-level description

1.  **Pool withdraw:**

    1.  **No matching process:** If some of the user's liquidity is
        supplied on the pool, Morpho withdraws the corresponding part of
        its position on the underlying pool. It favors this option to
        maximize the user's matched peer-to-peer liquidity and, thus,
        their capital efficiency. A `withdraw` on the underlying pool is
        performed.

    2.  **Reduce peer-to-peer supply delta:** Morpho reduces the
        peer-to-peer supply delta if there is one. It favors this option
        before the transfer withdraw to minimize the delta. A `withdraw`
        on the pool is performed to reduce the peer-to-peer supply
        delta.

2.  **Peer-to-peer withdraw:**

    1.  **Transfer withdraw:**

        1.  **Promote suppliers:** If the user is matched peer-to-peer,
            Morpho replaces him with other pool suppliers. It favors
            this option before the breaking withdraw to maximize the
            total peer-to-peer liquidity. The matching engine tries to
            match as much liquidity as possible from pool suppliers. The
            liquidity is retrieved by a call to `withdraw` on the
            underlying pool.

    2.  **Breaking withdraw:**

        1.  **Demote borrowers:** Morpho breaks the peer-to-peer credit
            lines of the withdrawing user with the matched borrowers and
            reconnects them to the pool. The matching engine tries to
            unmatch as much debt as possible from peer-to-peer
            borrowers. A `borrow` on the pool is performed to reconnect
            the borrowers to the pool. The borrowed assets are
            transferred to the withdrawer.

        2.  **Increase peer-to-peer borrow delta:** Suppose the gas
            available for matching was not enough to free enough
            liquidity. In that case, Morpho still performs the breaking
            withdraw, reconnecting the peer-to-peer borrowers to the
            pool via a borrow on the pool, and increases the
            peer-to-peer borrow delta. A part of the peer-to-peer
            matched borrow is now on the pool, and the indexes will be
            updated accordingly from now, growing at a higher rate.

Notice that the `gasLeft` value returned from the call to
`matchSuppliers` determines how much gas the call to `unmatchBorrowers`
is allowed to consume.

### Repay {#repay-delta}

#### High-level description

1.  **Pool repay:**

    1.  **No matching process:** If some of the user's debt is borrowed
        from the pool, Morpho repays liquidity from the underlying pool.
        It favors this option to maximize the user's matched liquidity
        and capital efficiency. A `repay` is performed on the underlying
        pool.

    2.  **Reduce peer-to-peer supply delta** Morpho reduces the
        peer-to-peer borrow delta if there is one. It favors this option
        before the transfer repay to minimize the delta. A `repay` on
        the pool is performed to reduce the peer-to-peer borrow delta.

2.  **Fee repay:** The fee charged by Morpho is accounted when users
    repay their peer-to-peer positions. The total amount of the fee
    accumulated over all the users can be computed by subtracting the
    real amount (subtracting the delta) of supply in peer-to-peer to the
    real amount of borrow in peer-to-peer. This difference comes from
    the reserve factor which is making the peer-to-peer borrow index
    grow at a higher speed than the peer-to-peer-supply index. The
    peer-to-peer position of the user is updated accordingly to the fee
    that is repaid, making this operation seamless when interacting with
    the protocol.

3.  **Peer-to-peer repay:**

    1.  **Transfer repay:**

        1.  **Promote borrowers:** If the user is matched peer-to-peer,
            Morpho replaces the peer-to-peer credit lines with other
            pool borrowers. It favors this option before the breaking
            repay to maximize the total peer-to-peer liquidity. The
            matching engine tries to match as much debt as possible from
            pool borrowers. A `repay` on the pool is performed to cut
            those borrowers debt on the pool.

    2.  **Breaking repay:**

        1.  **Demote suppliers:** Morpho breaks the peer-to-peer credit
            lines of the repaying user with the remaining matched
            suppliers and deposits the unmatched liquidity on the
            underlying pool. The matching engine tries to unmatch as
            much liquidity as possible from peer-to-peer suppliers.
            Morpho `supply` on the underlying pool, to reconnect the
            suppliers to the pool.

        2.  **Increase peer-to-peer supply delta:** If the gas available
            for matching was not enough to free enough liquidity, Morpho
            still performs the breaking repay (reconnection of
            peer-to-peer suppliers by a supply on the pool) and
            increases the peer-to-peer supply delta. A part of the
            peer-to-peer matched supply is now on the pool, and the
            indexes will be updated accordingly from now, growing at a
            lower rate.

## Impact on rates {#impact-rates}

Assume that $\lambda^{\gamma^S}$ and $\lambda^{\gamma^B}$ are the
peer-to-peer supply index and peer-to-peer borrow index. This notation
is introduced to take into account the delta mechanism (in addition to
the reserve factor and the peer-to-peer cursor). We want to compute
those indexes. We define the supply and borrow share of the delta as
follows: $$\begin{aligned}
    \gamma^S &= \frac{\delta^S \cdot \lambda^S}{S^{P2P} \cdot \lambda^{\gamma^S}}\\
    \gamma^B &= \frac{\delta^B \cdot \lambda^B}{B^{P2P} \cdot \lambda^{\gamma^B}}
\end{aligned}$$ We want the part of the matched liquidity corresponding
to the delta to grow at a speed that depends on the pool rate ($r^S$ and
$r^B$). The rest should to grow at a speed that depends on the
peer-to-peer rate ($r^{\rho^S}$ and $r^{\rho^B}$). It implies that the
resulting rates are, for the supply indexes: $$\begin{aligned}
    r^{\gamma^S} &= (1-\gamma^S) r^{\rho^S} + \gamma^S r^S\\
    &= (1-\gamma^S)((1-\alpha + \rho\alpha)r^S + (\alpha - \rho \alpha) r^B) + \rho r^S\\
    &= (1-(1-\gamma^S)(1-\rho)\alpha)r^S + (1-\gamma^S)(1-\rho)\alpha r^B
\end{aligned}$$ and for the borrow indexes: $$\begin{aligned}
    r^{\gamma^B} &= (1-\gamma^B) r^{\rho^B} + \gamma^B r^B\\
    &= (1-\gamma^B)((1-\rho)(1-\alpha)r^S + (\rho + \alpha -\rho\alpha) r^B) + \gamma^B r^B\\
    &= (1-\gamma^B)(1-\rho)(1-\alpha) r^S + (1 - (1-\gamma^B)(1-\rho)(1-\alpha)) r^B
\end{aligned}$$ Let $t, t' \in \mathbb{N}$ with $t' < t$. Using
theorem [2](#index-calc){reference-type="ref" reference="index-calc"},
we get: $$\begin{aligned}
\lambda^{\gamma^S}_t &\approx \lambda^{\gamma^S}_{t'} [(1-(1-\gamma^S_{t'})(1-\rho)\alpha)
\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (1-\gamma^S_{t'})(1-\rho)\alpha \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}}]\\
\lambda^{\gamma^B}_t &\approx \lambda^{\gamma^B}_{t'} [(1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha) \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (1 - (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha)) \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}}]
\end{aligned}
$$

Those formulas are efficient computations that come from approximating
the desired rates when taking into account the reserve factor and the
delta mechanism. The Morpho protocol does not update the rates but
updates the indexes instead, using the formulas above.

$$
\label{gamma-rate-supply-update}
\lambda^{\gamma^S}_t = \lambda^{\gamma^S}_{t'} [(1-(1-\gamma^S_{t'})(1-\rho)\alpha)
\frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (1-\gamma^S_{t'})(1-\rho)\alpha \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}}]\\
$$

$$
\label{gamma-rate-borrow-update}
\lambda^{\gamma^B}_t = \lambda^{\gamma^B}_{t'} [(1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha) \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (1 - (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha)) \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}}]
$$

To sum up, the pool's spread is $\Delta = r^B - r^S$ and two factors can
increase Morpho's peer-to-peer spread: the reserve factor and the
deltas. The difference $r^B - r^\alpha$ is denoted by $\Delta^B$ in the
following diagram and the reserve factor $\rho$ can be seen as a
proportion of the improvement that is taken on the borrow and supply
side, without taking into account the deltas. Similarly, the
peer-to-peer deltas can be seen as the proportion of the peer-to-peer
amount that is actually on the pool. We see that those two factors are
multiplicative: the proportion of the improvement that is lost on the
rate $r^{\gamma^B}$ is given by $1 - (1 - \rho) (1 - \gamma ^B)$. We can
thus see the reserve factor as a cut on the improvement compared to the
pool, taking into account the deltas.

The following theorem gives us an intuition about how the deltas evolve
if they are not reduced by new interactions with the protocol.

**Theorem 5**. _Between two updates with no other interaction on Morpho,
the share of the supply delta $\gamma^S$ is decreasing, and the share of
the borrow delta $\gamma^B$ is increasing._
:::

::: proof
_Proof._ We make use of the previous notations and
formulas [\[gamma-rate-supply-update\]](#gamma-rate-supply-update){reference-type="ref"
reference="gamma-rate-supply-update"}
and [\[gamma-rate-borrow-update\]](#gamma-rate-borrow-update){reference-type="ref"
reference="gamma-rate-borrow-update"}. Since we are looking at the delta
shares between two updates with no interaction with Morpho in between,
the quantities $\delta^S$, $\delta^B$, $S^{P2P}$, and $B^{P2P}$ are
constant. Thus, we only have to show that: $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda^S_{t'}}{\lambda^{\gamma^S}_{t'}} \cdot \frac{\lambda^{\gamma^S}_t}{\lambda^S_t} &\geq 1 \\
\frac{\lambda^B_{t'}}{\lambda^{\gamma^B}_{t'}} \cdot \frac{\lambda^{\gamma^B}_t}{\lambda^B_t} &\leq 1
\end{aligned}$$ We have $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda^S_{t'}}{\lambda^{\gamma^S}_{t'}} \cdot \frac{\lambda^{\gamma^S}_t}{\lambda^S_t} &= \frac{\lambda^S_{t'}}{\lambda^S_t} \cdot [(1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha) \frac{\lambda^S_t}{\lambda^S_{t'}} + (1 - (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha)) \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}}]\\
&= (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha) + (1 - (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha)) \cdot \frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} \cdot \frac{\lambda^S_{t'}}{\lambda^S_t}
\end{aligned}$$ Since the borrow index grows more rapidly on the pool
than the supply index, we have
$\frac{\lambda^B_t}{\lambda^B_{t'}} \cdot \frac{\lambda^S_{t'}}{\lambda^S_t} \geq 1$.
This implies that
$$\frac{\lambda^S_{t'}}{\lambda^{\gamma^S}_{t'}} \cdot \frac{\lambda^{\gamma^S}_t}{\lambda^S_t} \leq (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha) + (1 - (1-\gamma^B_{t'})(1-\rho)(1-\alpha)) = 1$$ ◻

#### Base case

The inequality is clearly verified at deployment.

#### Induction step

Let $\sigma_i\in\Sigma$ be a state where the inequality is verified. Let
a transition which transits to the state $\sigma_r\in\Sigma$.

We treat the case where the transition is associated to the function
call to $\texttt{withdraw}$. By now, we only consider the market
$\theta$, as others are untouched, so theta can be omitted as a
subscript. Let $(\theta, u, x)\in D_{\texttt{withdraw}}$ be the input
for this function call.

We first consider the update of the indexes and try to prove that the
equality still holds at the state $\sigma_{r'}$, an intermediary state
just after the indexes update. Remark that the variables $\delta^S$ and
$S^{P2P}$ do not change when updating the index. This means that we have
$\sigma_{r'}(\delta^S) = \sigma_i(\delta^S)$ and
$\sigma_{r'}(S^{P2P}) = \sigma_i(S^{P2P})$.

We note $\sigma_i(\gamma^S)$ for:
$$\frac{\sigma_i(\delta^S)\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda^S)}{\sigma_i(S^{P2P}) \cdot \sigma_i(\lambda^{\gamma^S})}$$
Let us first consider this relation: $$\begin{aligned}
L &= \sum_u \sigma_{r'}(s_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S}) - \sigma_{r'}(\delta_\theta^S)\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^S_\theta)\\
&= \sum_u \sigma_i(s_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})\cdot\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})} - \sigma_i(\delta_\theta^S)\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda^S_\theta)\cdot\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^S_\theta)}{\sigma_i(\lambda^S_\theta)}\\
&= \sum_u \sigma_i(s_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})\cdot\left(\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})} - \sigma_i(\gamma_\theta^S)\cdot\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^S_\theta)}{\sigma_i(\lambda^S_\theta)}\right)
\end{aligned}$$ Translating the formula
[\[rho-rate-supply-update\]](#rho-rate-supply-update){reference-type="ref"
reference="rho-rate-supply-update"} into this state setting, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\rho^S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\rho^S})} = ~&(1 - (1 - \rho_\theta^S) \alpha) \cdot \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^S)}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^S)} ~+\\
    &(1 - \rho_\theta^S) \alpha \cdot \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^B)}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^B)}
\end{aligned}$$ Similarly, for
[\[gamma-rate-supply-update\]](#gamma-rate-supply-update){reference-type="ref"
reference="gamma-rate-supply-update"}, we get: $$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma^S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma^S})} = ~&(1 - (1 - \sigma_i(\gamma_\theta^S))(1 - \rho_\theta^S) \alpha) \cdot \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^S)}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^S)} ~+\\
    &(1 - \sigma_i(\gamma_\theta^S))(1 - \rho_\theta^S) \alpha \cdot \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^B)}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^B)}
\end{aligned}$$ so:
$$\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})} = (1-\sigma_i(\gamma_\theta^S))\cdot\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_S})} + \sigma_i(\gamma_\theta^S)\cdot\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^S_\theta)}{\sigma_i(\lambda^S_\theta)}$$
Using this last equality, we get: $$\begin{aligned}
L &= \sum_u \sigma_i(s_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})\cdot(1-\sigma_i(\gamma_\theta^S))\cdot\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_S})}\\
&= \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_S})}\left(\sum_u \sigma_i(s_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S}) - \sigma_i(\delta_\theta^S)\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda^S_\theta)\right)
\end{aligned}$$ Similarly: $$\begin{aligned}
R &= \sum_u \sigma_{r'}(b_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_B}) - \sigma_{r'}(\delta_\theta^B)\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^B_\theta)\\
&= \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_B})}{\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\rho_B})}\left(\sum_u \sigma_i(b_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_B}) - \sigma_i(\delta_\theta^B)\cdot\sigma_i(\lambda^B_\theta)\right)
\end{aligned}$$ Additionally, we notice that the growth of the
peer-to-peer supply index without taking into account the deltas is
smaller than the growth of the peer-to-peer borrow index:
$$\frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^{\rho_S})}{\sigma_i(\lambda^{\rho_S})} \leq \frac{\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^{\rho_B})}{\sigma_i(\lambda^{\rho_B})}$$
So, because the inequality is verified at the state $\sigma_i$:
$$\begin{gathered}
\sum_u \sigma_{r'}(s_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S}) - \sigma_{r'}(\delta_\theta^S)\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^S_\theta)\\
\leq \sum_u \sigma_{r'}(b_\theta^{P2P}(u))\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_B}) - \sigma_{r'}(\delta_\theta^B)\cdot\sigma_{r'}(\lambda^B_\theta)
\end{gathered}$$ We proved that the inequality holds at $\sigma_{r'}$ if
it held at $\sigma_i$. Now we will focus on $\sigma_r$, the state at the
end of the transition. From now, we will write $\lambda^S$ for
$\sigma_r(\lambda^S_\theta) = \sigma_{r'}(\lambda^S_\theta)$, and we do
the same for $\sigma_r(\lambda^B_\theta)$,
$\sigma_r(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})$ and
$\sigma_r(\lambda_\theta^{\gamma_B})$.

We do not go through the **pool withdraw** step, as it does not change
the peer-to-peer balance of any user nor any delta. Let us consider the
**reduce peer-to-peer supply delta** step. Let $x^{\delta_S}$ be the
amount that is reduced from the delta in the underlying unit (the first
$\texttt{matched}$ in the pseudo-code). The peer-to-peer supply delta is
reduced by $x^{\delta_S} / \lambda^S$, and the peer-to-peer supply
balance of the user is reduced by $x^{\delta_S} / \lambda^{\gamma_S}$.

Consider also the **promote suppliers** step. Let $x^{\mu_S}$ be the
total amount matched in underlying by $\texttt{matchSuppliers}$ (the
second $\texttt{matched}$ in the pseudo-code). The peer-to-peer supply
balance of the user is reduced by $x^{\mu_S} / \lambda^{\gamma_S}$. And
the sum of the other suppliers' balances is increased by
$x^{\mu_S} / \lambda^{\gamma_S}$.

Finally, consider the **demote borrowers** step. Let $x^{\mu_B}$ be the
total amount unmatched in underlying by $\texttt{unmatchBorrowers}$
($\texttt{unmatched}$ in the pseudo-code). Let $x^{\delta_B}$ be the
amount that is added to the borrow delta in the underlying unit
(`amount - unmatched` in the pseudo-code). The peer-to-peer supply
balance of the user is reduced by
$(x^{\mu_B} + x^{\delta_B}) / \lambda^{\gamma_S}$, and the sum of the
peer-to-peer borrow balances is reduced by
$x^{\mu_B} / \lambda^{\gamma_B}$. The peer-to-peer borrow delta is
increased by $x^{\delta_B} / \lambda^B$. Finally: $$\begin{aligned}
L = &\sum_u \sigma_r(s^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S} - \sigma_r(\delta^S) \cdot \lambda^S\\
= &\left(\sum_u \sigma_{r'}(s^{P2P}(u)) - \frac{x^{\delta_S}}{\lambda^{\gamma_S}} - \frac{x^{\mu_S}}{\lambda^{\gamma_S}} + \frac{x^{\mu_S}}{\lambda^{\gamma_S}} - \frac{(x^{\mu_B} + x^{\delta_B})}{\lambda^{\gamma_S}} \right)\cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S} - \\
&\left(\sigma_{r'}(\delta^S) - \frac{x^{\delta_S}}{\lambda^S}\right)\cdot \lambda^S\\
= &\sum_u \sigma_{r'}(s^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S} - \sigma_{r'}(\delta^S) \cdot \lambda^S - x^{\mu_B} - x^{\delta_B}\\
R = &\sum_u \sigma_r(b^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_B} - \sigma_r(\delta^B) \cdot \lambda^B\\
= &\left(\sum_u \sigma_{r'}(b^{P2P}(u)) - \frac{x^{\mu_B}}{\lambda^{\gamma_B}}\right)\cdot \lambda^{\gamma_B} -  \left(\sigma_{r'}(\delta^B) + \frac{x^{\delta_B}}{\lambda^B}\right)\cdot \lambda^B\\
= &\sum_u \sigma_{r'}(b^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_B} - \sigma_{r'}(\delta^B) \cdot \lambda^B - x^{\mu_B} - x^{\delta_B}
\end{aligned}$$ So: $$\begin{gathered}
\sum_u \sigma_r(s^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S} - \sigma_r(\delta^S) \cdot \sigma_r(\lambda^S)\\
\leq \sum_u \sigma_r(b^{P2P}(u)) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_B} - \sigma_r(\delta^B) \cdot \sigma_r(\lambda^B)
\end{gathered}$$ We could do the same proofs for all the other external
functions and for $\Gamma_{tick}$. ◻

reference="p2p-inequality-deltas"}, we know that, for each token
$\theta$, the following inequality stands:
$$\sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta - \delta^B_\theta \cdot \lambda^B_\theta \geq \sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S}_\theta - \delta^S_\theta \cdot \lambda_\theta^S$$
We also get the following equalities from the pool position's integrity
lemma [6](#pool-positions-integrity-deltas){reference-type="ref"
reference="pool-positions-integrity-deltas"}:
$$b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) = \delta_\theta^B + \sum_u b_\theta^{Pool}(u)$$
$$s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) = \delta_\theta^S + \sum_u s_\theta^{Pool}(u)$$
We still have the following inequality from the assumptions of the
theorem:
$$\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \sum_u \omega^B_\theta(u) \leq \sum_\theta  p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot \sum_u \omega^S_\theta(u)$$
Let us call $L$ and $R$ the left-hand side and the right-hand side of
the previous inequality, and reduce them. For $L$: $$\begin{aligned}
L = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \sum_u \omega^B_\theta(u)\\
  = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot \sum_u (b_\theta^{Pool}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B + b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{\gamma^B})\\
  = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot ( (b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) - \delta_\theta^B) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B + \sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{\gamma_B})\\
  = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B + \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot (\sum_u b_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_B}_\theta - \delta^B_\theta \cdot \lambda^B_\theta)\\
  \geq &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B + \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot (\sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S}_\theta - \delta^S_\theta \cdot \lambda_\theta^S)
\end{aligned}$$ And for $R$: $$\begin{aligned}
R = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot \sum_u \omega^S_\theta(u)\\
  = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot \sum_u (s_\theta^{Pool}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^S + s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})\\
  = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta  \cdot ( (s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) - \delta_\theta^S) \cdot \lambda_\theta^S + \sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda_\theta^{\gamma_S})\\
  = &\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^S + \sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot (\sum_u s_\theta^{P2P}(u) \cdot \lambda^{\gamma_S}_\theta - \delta^S_\theta \cdot \lambda^S_\theta)
\end{aligned}$$ So, because $F_\theta \leq 1$, we can still conclude
that:
$$\sum_\theta p_\theta \cdot b_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^B \leq \sum_\theta  p_\theta \cdot F_\theta \cdot s_\theta(\overline{M_\psi}) \cdot \lambda_\theta^S$$ ◻

# Conclusion

The Morpho protocol is an improvement of the established protocols for
loanable funds (see section [2](#on-chain-env){reference-type="ref"
reference="on-chain-env"}) that have seen a significant rise in
popularity in the past years. Such protocols have numerous advantages,
including high liquidity with the possibility to withdraw or borrow
significant amounts at any time. They also define robust risk parameters
which minimize the risk of insolvencies and liquidations in
high-volatility markets but require notably leaving a fraction of the
liquidity idle on the contract. The main idea of Morpho, explained in
section [3](#morpho-description){reference-type="ref"
reference="morpho-description"}, is to improve capital efficiency by
matching peer-to-peer the incoming liquidity as much as possible while
ensuring the same liquidity and at least the same rates as the
underlying lending pool by aggregating the remaining positions on it. In
doing so, we are faced with different challenges. First, we should
ensure that the protocol enjoys the same liquidity as the underlying
lending pool. It amounts to finding a fallback mechanism, notably
including the possibility to withdraw when matched peer-to-peer. A
solution to this problem was given in
section [3.3](#external-functions-morpho){reference-type="ref"
reference="external-functions-morpho"}, with detailed steps explaining
the process. Second, we should make sure that the position taken on the
pool is safe. This point has been formalized as the *non-liquidation
theorem*, and a clear proof was given in
section [3.4](#non-liquidation-section){reference-type="ref"
reference="non-liquidation-section"} and refined later in
section [6.4](#non-liquidation-delta){reference-type="ref"
reference="non-liquidation-delta"}. Third, we need relevant rates and a
robust system to account for them. In
section [5](#index-mechanism){reference-type="ref"
reference="index-mechanism"}, we turn to a general analysis of it, and
we prove that Morpho users enjoy improved rates compared to users of the
underlying pool. Finally, one last challenge is to ensure that the
protocol can scale by bounding the gas usage of any transaction, no
matter its size. This problem comes from the matching engine, described
in section [4](#matching-engine){reference-type="ref"
reference="matching-engine"}, as it has to scale with the number of
users. Section [6](#delta-mechanism){reference-type="ref"
reference="delta-mechanism"} returns to the scalability problem with a
solution called the delta mechanism, where proofs and previous results
are updated to consider this new mechanism.

[^12]: Compound calls it mint in reference to the fact that cTokens are
    minted during this operation, and Aave calls it deposit.

[^13]: Compound calls it redeem.

[^14]: Note that this can be seen as converting c/aTokens into
    underlying tokens.

[^15]: Name used by Compound and Aave, even though Aave has two values
    for it, depending on how "dangerous" the position is considered. See

    documentation [@aavedoc].

[^16]: Aave calls it the `liquidationBonus`.

[^17]: Thus, the fee can be seen as a cut in the improvement that Morpho
    enables

[^18]: Aave uses an approximation of this method for borrow interests.

[^19]: This is the case in reality because indexes are updated at each
    pool interaction, and rates only change at pool interactions.

[^20]: This is the method used by Compound and for supply interest by
    Aave.

[^21]: The name \"delta\" refers to this difference.
